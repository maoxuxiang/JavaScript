		<div id="accordion">
			<h3>
				Case 1 - <span class="diseasetext" value="RA">Rheumatoid
					Arthritis</span>
			</h3>
			<div>
				<p>John Rheumatology is a 59 y/o WM with a history of moderate
					rheumatoid arthritis (RA), class II heart failure (HF), and
					hypertension. His RA has been managed with methotrexate (MTX) for 7
					months, without complete remission. His current dose of MTX was
					titrated during this period, starting at 7.5 mg weekly towards 25
					mg weekly. He has also been taking prednisone 15 mg/day during the
					same period. His HF and hypertension have been well-controlled with
					lisinopril 15 mg / day and carvedilol 25 mg twice daily. He
					presents to the office today because his pain on wrists, hands, and
					feet has gotten worse. He has been receiving advertisements in the
					mail from manufacturers of a variety of other medications for
					rheumatoid arthritis and he wonders if he might benefit. However,
					reading through the potential side effects (cancer, sudden death),
					he is hesitant to try these medications if there is no clear
					benefit.</p>
				<p>Would you change John's treatment strategy? If so, how?</p>
			</div>
			<h3>
				Case 2 - <span class="diseasetext" value="DM">Diabetes
					Mellitus</span>
			</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Agnes is a 51-year-old female with hypertension who received a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes a decade ago. She has been worried about her diabetes since then because she has not been able to gain complete control over it. Her glycated hemoglobin level was 7.0% for 1 year but gradually increased to 9.0%. For the past 2 years, she has been taking metformin 2000 mg daily. She is maintaining her weight at 165 pounds (75 kg), but she is not able to lose weight. Agnes goes to the gym and walks on a treadmill three times a week. She tells you that she has made as many lifestyle changes as she can. Agnes's hypertension is well controlled with an ACE inhibitor; she also takes a statin. Her most recent tests showed LDL cholesterol of 85 mg / dL and HDL of 62 mg / dL.</p>
				<p>Agnes hates needles and won't use insulin. Her sister, who also has diabetes, was receiving glipizide but had episodes of hypoglycemia while taking that drug, including one episode that resulted in an auto accident. Agnes is also worried about weight gain associated with that drug. Her sister recently switched from glipizide to saxagliptin and reports to Agnes that she has had no further episodes of hypoglycemia. Agnes has also heard about a new class of diabetes drugs that works by eliminating excess glucose through the urine. She wants to know about the safety of the newer drugs and asks specifically about saxagliptin and the new class of drugs. You explain to her that the drugs she is asking about are in different classes - dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors ("gliptins") and sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors ("gliflozins").</p>
				<p>Do you think a second drug should be added to the metformin Agnes is currently receiving? If so, what drug?</p>
			</div>
			<h3>
				Case 3 - <span class="diseasetext" value="VUR">Vesicoureteral Reflux</span>
			</h3>
			<div>
				<p>A 6-year-old girl was recently referred to your clinic for further evaluation and management of vesicoureteral reflux, which had first been discovered after she presented at 1 year of age with a temperature of 39.5°C and irritability. Culture of a urine specimen at that time showed more than 106 colony-forming units of pansensitive Escherichia coli per milliliter, and she was treated with intravenous ampicillin for several days, followed by oral ampicillin, for a total of 14 days of therapy. After the patient no longer had a fever and a urine culture was sterile, voiding cystourethrography was performed while the patient was still receiving ampicillin. The voiding cystourethrogram showed bilateral grade III vesicoureteral reflux, and renal ultrasonography revealed normal findings. Radionuclide renal scintiscanning was not performed.</p>
				
				<p>Prophylactic trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was administered at bedtime each night, and during the ensuing year, the patient had no urinary tract infections, as judged by sterile surveillance cultures of urine specimens and sterile cultures when she had any febrile episodes. A follow-up radionuclide voiding cystourethrogram when the patient was 2.5 years of age still showed bilateral grade III vesicoureteral reflux.</p>
				
				<p>Subsequently, the family moved a number of times. The patient had several episodes of high fever, but no urine cultures were documented. At 4 years of age, she was seen again at the center where she had been followed, and she still had bilateral grade III vesicoureteral reflux. Continued antibiotic prophylaxis was recommended, but because of the family's moves, the degree of adherence was unclear. However, the child remained well, and her parents decided to stop the prophylactic antibiotics.</p>
				
				<p>The child was toilet trained at 2 years of age, and she had no history of constipation or bowel irregularities. She had occasional nocturnal enuresis until the age of 4. She has not had enuresis since that time. Studies at the center where she had been followed documented measurements of serum creatinine of 0.3 mg per deciliter (27 μmol per liter) and blood urea nitrogen of 11 mg per deciliter (3.9 mmol per liter). Family history includes no chronic kidney disease, although the child's mother had a urinary tract infection when pregnant with this child, and the child's maternal grandmother, who is 51 years old, has had hypertension.</p>
				
				<p>The patient, now 6 years of age, and her family have recently moved to your city, and her new primary care pediatrician refers her to you for consultation. She has been well recently, without reports of any medical problems. On examination of the child, you find that the height and weight are at the 50th percentile for age and the blood pressure is 88/50 mm Hg. Results of a general physical examination, including examination of the external genitalia, are normal. You obtain a urine specimen; culture of the specimen shows fewer than 1000 colony-forming units. A urinalysis reveals a specific gravity of 1.018 and a pH of 6.0; urine dipstick testing is negative for leukocytes, nitrites, protein, blood, glucose, ketones, and urobilinogen. The sediment shows no bacteria, 0 to 1 white cells, no red cells, and no casts per high-power field. You also obtain a radionuclide voiding cystourethrogram, which reveals that the patient still has bilateral grade III reflux. A renal ultrasound study shows that the kidney size is normal. A radionuclide renal scan is also normal. The parents ask whether you think the patient needs antibiotic prophylaxis and whether you would recommend any procedure to stop the vesicoureteral reflux.</p>
				
				<p>Which one of the following approaches would you find most appropriate for this patient?</p>
				<ul class="circletype">
					<li>Option 1: Watchful Waiting without Antibiotics</li>
					<li>Option 2: Continuous Antimicrobial Prophylaxis</li>
					<li>Option 3: Repair of the Vesicoureteral Reflux</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>
				Case 4 - <span class="diseasetext" value="">Chronic Obstructive
					Pulmonary Disease</span>
			</h3>
			<div>
				<p>A 68-year-old man who recently moved to the area presents to the
					urgent care clinic with an acute complaint of productive cough. He
					has a 20-pack year history of smoking but quit five years ago. He
					started last year on an albuterol inhaler by his prior physician.
					On further review, he has had no fevers, sweats, weight loss,
					nausea, or vomiting. He reports that for the past year he typically
					begins each morning with productive cough but is fine the rest of
					the day. This pattern is somewhat worse over the past two weeks,
					with his cough persisting for most of the morning. On examination
					he is a thin man in no acute distress. He is afebrile, breathing
					comfortably, with decreased breath sounds but no focal wheezes or
					areas of consolidation on pulmonary examination. The rest of his
					examination is within normal limits.</p>
				<p>What would be your next step in the management of this patient?</p>
				<ul class="circletype">
					<li>Prescribe a macrolide or cephalosporin antibiotic</li>
					<li>Initiate a 21-day tapered oral glucocorticoid regimen</li>
					<li>Initiate a long-acting beta2-agonist</li>
					<li>Admit the patient to the hospital</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Which of the following studies would you use in his long-term
					management?</p>
				<ul class="circletype">
					<li>Chest x-ray</li>
					<li>High-resolution chest CT</li>
					<li>Spirometry</li>
					<li>Sleep Study</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<h3>
				Case 5 - <span class="diseasetext" value="">Urethritis</span>
			</h3>
			<div>
				<p>The patient is a 30-year-old man complaining of urethral pain
					during urination with frank purulent discharge for 48 hours. He has
					no history of a prior sexually transmitted infections. He had a lot
					of extramarital relationships during business travel, sometimes
					with prostitutes. He had not always used a condom and his last
					unprotected sexual encounter occurred about three days previously.
					The patient's illness history confirmed the presence of urethral
					purulent discharge, staining the slip. Urination was painful,
					especially the first one in the morning. Systemic symptoms (fever,
					chills, sweats, nausea) and testicle pain were absent. The physical
					examination confirmed the presence of urethral discharge, testicles
					were normal, there was no inguinal adenopathy nor genital ulcer,
					the mouth, pharynx and tonsils showed no anomalies. Urethral swab
					and urine tests for N. gonorrheae and C. trachomatis were ordered.</p>
				<p>What antibiotic treatment do you prescribe to this patient?</p>
			</div>
			
			
			<h3>
				Case 6.1 - <span class="diseasetext" value="">Congestive Heart
					Failure - Simvastatin</span>
			</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Mr. Peters, male, 72 years of age visits your practice because he increasingly experiences shortness of breath during exercise. He has no chest pain.  His past medical history is significant for hypertension since 1988, and an anterior wall myocardial infarction in 2001.  He takes chlorthalidone 12.5 mg q.d.; enalapril 5 mg b.i.d.; acetylsalicylic acid 80 mg q.d.; simvastatin 40 mg q.d.</p>
				<p>On physical exam his blood pressure is 146/87 mmHg, pulse 92 bpm regular, a broadened and sustained apical impulse in left decubital position, and normal pulmonary breathing sounds.</p>
				<p>Additional tests reveal plasma amino-terminal B-type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) level 1010 pg/ml (completely normal when <125 pg/ml ≈ 15 pmol/l).  ECG shows abnormal Q-waves suggestive for prior MI.  Echocardiography shows a somewhat dilated heart with wall movement abnormalities compatible with a prior MI, and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%. No clinical relevant valvular disease.</p>
				<p>Conclusion: Heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction caused by long-term HT and prior MI.</p>
				<p>Do you continue or stop prescribing simvastatin?</p>
				<ul class="circletype">
					<li>Continue</li>
					<li>Continue, but only if the patient would have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction</li>
					<li>Continue, but only if the patient had HF-REF and a history of ischemic heart disease</li>
					<li>Stop</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			
			
			<h3>
				Case 6.2 - <span class="diseasetext" value="CHF-Metformin">Congestive Heart
					Failure - Metformin</span>
			</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Mr. Peters, male, 72 years of age visits your practice because he increasingly experiences shortness of breath during exercise. He has no chest pain.  His past medical history is significant for hypertension since 1988, and an anterior wall myocardial infarction in 2001.  He takes chlorthalidone 12.5 mg q.d.; enalapril 5 mg b.i.d.; acetylsalicylic acid 80 mg q.d.; simvastatin 40 mg q.d.</p>
				<p>On physical exam his blood pressure is 146/87 mmHg, pulse 92 bpm regular, a broadened and sustained apical impulse in left decubital position, and normal pulmonary breathing sounds.</p>
				<p>Additional tests reveal plasma amino-terminal B-type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) level 1010 pg/ml (completely normal when <125 pg/ml ≈ 15 pmol/l).  ECG shows abnormal Q-waves suggestive for prior MI.  Echocardiography shows a somewhat dilated heart with wall movement abnormalities compatible with a prior MI, and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%. No clinical relevant valvular disease.</p>
				<p>Conclusion: Heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction caused by long-term HT and prior MI.</p>
				<p>During the last consultation you decided to add metoprolol succinate 12.5 mg q.d. with the intention to gradually increase the dosage of this β-blocker up to the maximal tolerated dosage over the coming weeks ('starting low, going slow').</p>
				<p>We are four weeks later now, and Mr. Peters returns to the surgery for his next appointment. When asked for, he tells you that he tolerates the last prescribed drug well (metoprolol succinate; you have already increased the dosage to 25 mg o.d. two weeks ago), and does not experience any side effects, although, it seems somewhat harder to 'get going', and after his 'walking block' he feels somewhat more tired than before the start of metoprolol.  On physical examination, his blood pressure is 122/72 mmHg and his pulse is 72 bpm regular. No weight gain, no ankle edema and normal pulmonary breathing sounds.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>Do you want to change his medication?</p>
				<ul class="circletype">
					<li>Yes, double the &beta;-blocker dosage</li>
					<li>No, no increase of &beta;-blocker dosage now</li>
					<li>Yes, temporarily increase the dosage of furosemide</li>
					<li>Yes, reduce metoprolol to 12.5 mg</li>
					<li>Yes, stop metoprolol</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<h3>
				Case 7 - <span class="diseasetext" value="AFIB">Atrial Fibrillation</span>
			</h3>
			<div>
				<p>A 75 year old man complains of tiredness when walking or climbing
					stairs. He states that he normally is able to walk without becoming
					tired, but that over the last month he "just runs out of energy"
					after walking more than one block. The other day, per his usual
					pattern, he walked to the near by grocery store but found that,
					once there, he did not have the energy or strength to walk back.
					His wife reports some recent cognitive changes in her husband, such
					as forgetting his daily vitamins and having difficulty organizing
					his daily activities. His medical history is significant for a GI
					bleed 5 years ago secondary to several small angiodysplasias that
					required brief hospitalization. He takes no medications and has no
					allergies. On physical exam he is noted to have an irregularly
					irregular heart rate of 130, blood pressure 150/80, and an ECG
					consistent with AF. He has normal vesicular breath sounds without
					rales, rhonchi, or wheezes; his extremities are without edema; and
					he has no focal neurologic findings.</p>
				<p>What is the next best step in his management?</p>
			</div>
			<h3>
				Case 8 - <span class="diseasetext" value="Depression">Depression</span>
			</h3>
			<div>
				<p>A 75-year-old woman with stage IV breast cancer metastatic to the
					liver and the vertebral bodies comes to your office for a follow up
					visit. She states that her pain is well controlled but that she has
					felt little interest or pleasure in activities, has had a poor
					appetite, and is not sleeping well. She does not have active
					suicidal ideation, but sometimes feels she would be better off
					dying. She is taking MS contin 30 mg once daily, lortab 5/325 every
					6 hours, and sertraline 100mg every day. On physical exam she is
					cachectic, has mild jaundice, and ascites. Her serum creatinine is
					2.1 (baseline is 2.0), ALT/AST are 244 and 230, and her total
					bilirubin is 6.0 mg/dL. Her chart notes a 5 pound weight loss.</p>
				<p>What changes would you make to her medication regimen?</p>
