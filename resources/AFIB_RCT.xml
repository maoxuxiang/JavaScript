		<summary>Hemorrhagic stroke rates were higher on warfarin in Asians versus non-Asians, despite similar blood pressure, younger age, and lower international normalized ratio values. Hemorrhagic strokes were significantly reduced by DE in both Asians and non-Asians. DE benefits were consistent across Asian and non-Asian subgroups.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Intracranial hemorrhage rates are higher in Asians than non-Asians, especially in patients receiving warfarin. This randomized evaluation of long-term anticoagulation therapy subgroup analysis assessed dabigatran etexilate (DE) and warfarin effects on stroke and bleeding rates in patients from Asian and non-Asian countries.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>There were 2782 patients (15%) from 10 Asian countries and 15 331 patients from 34 non-Asian countries. A Cox regression model, with terms for treatment, region, and their interaction was used.</fragment>

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Rates of stroke or systemic embolism in Asians were 3.06% per year on warfarin, 2.50% per year on DE 110 mg BID (DE 110), and 1.39% per year on DE 150 mg BID (DE 150); in non-Asians, the rates were 1.48%, 1.37%, and 1.06% per year with no significant treatment-by-region interactions. Hemorrhagic stroke on warfarin occurred more often in Asians than non-Asians (hazard ratio [HR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-4.7; P=0.007), with significant reductions for DE compared with warfarin in both Asian (DE 110 versus warfarin HR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03-0.66 and DE 150 versus warfarin HR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.06-0.77) and non-Asian (DE 110 versus warfarin HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.19-0.72 and DE 150 versus warfarin HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.13-0.58) patients. Major bleeding rates in Asians were significantly lower on DE (both doses) than warfarin (warfarin 3.82% per year, DE 110 2.22% per year, and DE 150 2.17% per year).</fragment>

				<fragment>AF/AT recurrence is common after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI).</fragment>

			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We included 102 patients from 2 centers (age 63 ± 10 years; 33 women; left atrium 38 ± 7 mm; left ventricular ejection fraction 61 ± 6%) with symptomatic paroxysmal AF. A 3-dimensional mapping system and circumferential mapping catheter were used in all patients for PVI. In group 1 (n = 50), the procedural endpoint was bidirectional block across the ablation line. In group 2 (n = 52), additional UE to bipolar pacing at an output of 10 mA and 2-ms pulse width was required. The primary endpoint was freedom from any AF/AT (&gt;30 s) after discontinuation of antiarrhythmic drugs.</fragment>

				<fragment>Procedural endpoints were successfully achieved in all patients. Procedure duration was significantly longer in group 2 (185 ± 58 min vs. 139 ± 57 min; p &lt; 0.001); however, fluoroscopy times were not different (23 ± 9 min vs. 23 ± 9 min; p = 0.49). After a follow-up of 12 months in all patients, 26 patients (52%) in group 1 versus 43 (82.7%) in group 2 were free from any AF/AT (p = 0.001) after a single procedure.

		<summary>NT-proBNP levels are often elevated in AF and independently associated with an increased risk of stroke and mortality. NT-proBNP improves risk stratification beyond the CHA2DS2VASc score and might be a novel tool for improved stroke prediction in AF.

			<section label="OBJECTIVES" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>This study sought to assess the prognostic value of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) enrolled in the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for the Prevention of Stroke in Subjects With Atrial Fibrillation) trial, and the treatment effect of apixaban according to NT-proBNP levels.</fragment>

				<fragment>Natriuretic peptides are associated with mortality and cardiovascular events in several cardiac diseases.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In the ARISTOTLE trial, 18,201 patients with AF were randomized to apixaban or warfarin. Plasma samples at randomization were available from 14,892 patients. The association between NT-proBNP concentrations and clinical outcomes was evaluated using Cox proportional hazard models, after adjusting for established cardiovascular risk factors.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Quartiles of NT-proBNP were: Q1, ≤363 ng/l; Q2, 364 to 713 ng/l; Q3, 714 to 1,250 ng/l; and Q4, &gt;1,250 ng/l. During 1.9 years, the annual rates of stroke or systemic embolism ranged from 0.74% in the bottom NT-proBNP quartile to 2.21% in the top quartile, an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.35 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.62 to 3.40; p &lt; 0.0001). Annual rates of cardiac death ranged from 0.86% in Q1 to 4.14% in Q4, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.50 (95% CI: 1.81 to 3.45; p &lt; 0.0001). Adding NT-proBNP levels to the CHA2DS2VASc score improved C-statistics from 0.62 to 0.65 (p = 0.0009) for stroke or systemic embolism and from 0.59 to 0.69 for cardiac death (p &lt; 0.0001).

At 12 months, treatment success was 69.9% (114 of 163) of cryoblation patients compared with 7.3% of antiarrhythmic drug patients (absolute difference, 62.6% [p &lt; 0.001]). Sixty-five (79%) drug-treated patients crossed over to cryoablation during 12 months of study follow-up due to recurrent, symptomatic AF, constituting drug treatment failure.

		<summary>Although postoperative atrial fibrillation remains a common complication of cardiac surgery, there was a significant decrease in the incidence of postoperative cerebrovascular accidents since routine ligation of the left atrial appendage was undertaken.

				<fragment>A total of 2067 patients were reviewed. Propensity score matching was used to create matched groups based on left atrial appendage ligation, and 631 patients were matched in each group. Subjects with postoperative atrial fibrillation were 2.4 times (95% confidence interval, 1.51-2.82) more likely to undergo valve surgery, 2.11 times (95% confidence interval, 1.56-2.86) more likely to be aged more than 75 years, and 1.36 times (95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.80) more likely to have undergone left atrial appendage ligation. In the left atrial appendage ligation group with postoperative atrial fibrillation (n = 145), there were zero subjects (0%) with a postoperative cardiovascular accident.

			<section label="CONTEXT" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Postoperative atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF) is one of the most common complications of cardiac surgery and significantly increases morbidity and health care utilization. A few small trials have evaluated whether long-chain n-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) reduce postoperative AF, with mixed results.</fragment>

		<id>23036896</id>
		<updated>2012-11-19</updated>
		<summary>Because apixaban has benefits over warfarin that are consistent across patient risk of stroke and bleeding as assessed by the CHADS2, CHA2DS2VASc, and HAS-BLED scores, these scores might be less relevant when used to tailor apixaban treatment to individual patients than they are for warfarin. Further improvement in risk stratification for both stroke and bleeding is needed, particularly for patients with atrial fibrillation at low risk for these events.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>The Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial showed that apixaban is better than warfarin at prevention of stroke or systemic embolism, causes less bleeding, and results in lower mortality. We assessed in this trial's participants how results differed according to patients' CHADS(2), CHA(2)DS(2)VASc, and HAS-BLED scores, used to predict the risk of stroke and bleeding.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>ARISTOTLE was a double-blind, randomised trial that enrolled 18,201 patients with atrial fibrillation in 39 countries. Patients were randomly assigned apixaban 5 mg twice daily (n=9120) or warfarin (target international normalised ratio 2·0-3·0; n=9081). The primary endpoint was stroke or systemic embolism. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. We calculated CHADS(2), CHA(2)DS(2)VASc, and HAS-BLED scores of patients at randomisation. Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat, and safety analyses were of the population who received the study drug. ARISTOTLE is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00412984.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Apixaban significantly reduced stroke or systemic embolism with no evidence of a differential effect by risk of stroke (CHADS(2) 1, 2, or ≥3, p for interaction=0·4457; or CHA(2)DS(2)VASc 1, 2, or ≥3, p for interaction=0·1210) or bleeding (HAS-BLED 0-1, 2, or ≥3, p for interaction=0·9422). Patients who received apixaban had lower rates of major bleeding than did those who received warfarin, with no difference across all score categories (CHADS(2), p for interaction=0·4018; CHA(2)DS(2)VASc, p for interaction=0·2059; HAS-BLED, p for interaction=0·7127). The relative risk reduction in intracranial bleeding tended to be greater in patients with HAS-BLED scores of 3 or higher (hazard ratio [HR] 0·22, 95% CI 0·10-0·48) than in those with HAS-BLED scores of 0-1 (HR 0·66, 0·39-1·12; p for interaction=0·0604).</fragment>

		<summary>Short-term antiarrhythmic drug treatment after cardioversion is less effective than is long-term treatment, but can prevent most recurrences of atrial fibrillation.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Antiarrhythmic drugs prolong the atrial action potential and refractory period, and thereby prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation after cardioversion. The atrial action potential normalises after 2-4 weeks of sinus rhythm, suggesting that antiarrhythmic drugs might not be needed beyond that period. Therefore, we investigated whether short-term antiarrhythmic drug treatment after cardioversion is non-inferior to long-term treatment.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We enrolled patients in a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint assessment trial between May 4, 2007, and March 12, 2010, at 44 centres in Germany. Eligible patients were adults with persistent atrial fibrillation undergoing planned cardioversion. After successful cardioversion, patients were randomly assigned in permuted blocks of six per centre to: no antiarrhythmic drug treatment (control); treatment with flecainide (200-300 mg per day) for 4 weeks (short-term treatment); or flecainide for 6 months (long-term treatment). The primary endpoint was time to persistent atrial fibrillation or death. Patients and clinicians were unmasked to group assignment and treatment. The primary outcome was assessed in a core laboratory, members of which were masked to treatment group. Patients were monitored for 6 months by daily telemetric electrocardiograph (ECG) and centrally adjudicated Holter ECG recordings whenever atrial fibrillation was noted in two consecutive ECGs. Analyses were per protocol. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN62728742.</fragment>

			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>After assay sensitivity was established with 4-week follow-up data from 242 patients showing that flecainide was superior to no treatment (Kaplan-Meier survival 70·2%vs 52·5%; p=0·0160), the trial continued to compare short-term versus long-term treatment. The primary outcome occurred in 120 (46%) of 261 patients receiving short-term treatment and in 103 (39%) of 263 patients receiving long-term treatment (event-free survival 48·4% [95% CI 41·9-55·0] vs 56·4% [49·1-63·6]; Kaplan-Meier estimate of difference 7·9% [-1·9 to 17·7]; p=0·2081 for non-inferiority; margin prespecified at 12%). In a post-hoc landmark analysis of patients who had not reached the primary endpoint in the first month, long-term treatment was superior to short-term treatment (Kaplan-Meier estimate of difference 14·3% [5·1-23·6]; hazard ratio 0·31 [0·18-0·56]; p=0·0001).</fragment>

			</section>
			<section label="METHODS AND RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Amiodarone (A) or bepridil (B) was administered to 40 consecutive patients (36 male subjects, age 61 years) with persistent AF in a prospective, randomised, open label fashion. The pharmacological effects in bringing about conversion to sinus rhythm and subsequently maintaining sinus rhythm were evaluated. If sinus rhythm was not restored within 3 months, direct current (DC) cardioversion was performed. The incidence of adverse effects was also evaluated. Sinus rhythm was restored in seven (35%) of 20 patients in group A (average follow-up of 3.2 months) and in 17 (85%) of 20 in group B (average follow-up of 2.3 months) (p&lt;0.05). After pharmacological or DC cardioversion, sinus rhythm could be maintained in 10 (50%) of 20 patients in group A (average follow-up of 14.7 months) and 15 (75%) of 20 patients in group B (average follow-up of 15.6 months). QT interval and QTc were significantly prolonged compare with the baseline values in group B, but no torsade de pointes was recognised in any of the patients.

		<summary>The effects of apixaban versus warfarin were consistent in patients with AF with and without previous stroke or TIA. Owing to the higher risk of these outcomes in patients with previous stroke or TIA, the absolute benefits of apixaban might be greater in this population.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>In the ARISTOTLE trial, the rate of stroke or systemic embolism was reduced by apixaban compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Patients with AF and previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) have a high risk of stroke. We therefore aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of apixaban compared with warfarin in prespecified subgroups of patients with and without previous stroke or TIA.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Between Dec 19, 2006, and April 2, 2010, patients were enrolled in the ARISTOTLE trial at 1034 clinical sites in 39 countries. 18,201 patients with AF or atrial flutter were randomly assigned to receive apixaban 5 mg twice daily or warfarin (target international normalised ratio 2·0-3·0). The median duration of follow-up was 1·8 years (IQR 1·4-2·3). The primary efficacy outcome was stroke or systemic embolism, analysed by intention to treat. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding in the on-treatment population. All participants, investigators, and sponsors were masked to treatment assignments. In this subgroup analysis, we estimated event rates and used Cox models to compare outcomes in patients with and without previous stroke or TIA.

				<fragment>Of the trial population, 3436 (19%) had a previous stroke or TIA. In the subgroup of patients with previous stroke or TIA, the rate of stroke or systemic embolism was 2·46 per 100 patient-years of follow-up in the apixaban group and 3·24 in the warfarin group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·76, 95% CI 0·56 to 1·03); in the subgroup of patients without previous stroke or TIA, the rate of stroke or systemic embolism was 1·01 per 100 patient-years of follow-up with apixaban and 1·23 with warfarin (HR 0·82, 95% CI 0·65 to 1·03; p for interaction=0·71). The absolute reduction in the rate of stroke and systemic embolism with apixaban versus warfarin was 0·77 per 100 patient-years of follow-up (95% CI -0·08 to 1·63) in patients with and 0·22 (-0·03 to 0·47) in those without previous stroke or TIA.

				<fragment>During percutaneous LAA closure for stroke prophylaxis, the geometric variability of the LAA ostium may result in an incomplete seal of the LAA.

		<summary>In patients with atrial fibrillation, apixaban is similarly effective whether or not patients have had a previous stroke or TIA. Given that those with previous stroke or TIA have a higher risk of stroke, the absolute benefits might be greater in these patients.</summary>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>In the AVERROES study, apixaban, a novel factor Xa inhibitor, reduced the risk of stroke or systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation who were at high risk of stroke but unsuitable for vitamin K antagonist therapy. We aimed to investigate whether the subgroup of patients with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) would show a greater benefit from apixaban compared with aspirin than would patients without previous cerebrovascular events.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In AVERROES, 5599 patients (mean age 70 years) with atrial fibrillation who were at increased risk of stroke and unsuitable for vitamin K antagonist therapy were randomly assigned to receive apixaban (5 mg twice daily) or aspirin (81-324 mg per day). The mean follow-up was 1·1 years. The primary efficacy outcome was stroke or systemic embolism; the primary safety outcome was major bleeding. Patients and investigators were masked to study treatment. In this prespecified subgroup analysis, we used Kaplan-Meier estimates of 1-year event risk and Cox proportional hazards regression models to compare the effects of apixaban in patients with and without previous stroke or TIA. AVERROES is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00496769.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>In patients with previous stroke or TIA, ten events of stroke or systemic embolism occurred in the apixaban group (n=390, cumulative hazard 2·39% per year) compared with 33 in the aspirin group (n=374, 9·16% per year; hazard ratio [HR] 0·29, 95% CI 0·15-0·60). In those without previous stroke or TIA, 41 events occurred in the apixaban group (n=2417, 1·68% per year) compared with 80 in the aspirin group (n=2415, 3·06% per year; HR 0·51, 95% CI 0·35-0·74). The p value for interaction of the effects of aspirin and apixaban with previous cerebrovascular events was 0·17. Major bleeding was more frequent in patients with history of stroke or TIA than in patients without (HR 2·88, 95% CI 1·77-4·55) but risk of this event did not differ between treatment groups.</fragment>

				<fragment>One quarter of strokes are of unknown cause, and subclinical atrial fibrillation may be a common etiologic factor. Pacemakers can detect subclinical episodes of rapid atrial rate, which correlate with electrocardiographically documented atrial fibrillation.

			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We enrolled 2580 patients, 65 years of age or older, with hypertension and no history of atrial fibrillation, in whom a pacemaker or defibrillator had recently been implanted. We monitored the patients for 3 months to detect subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias (episodes of atrial rate &gt;190 beats per minute for more than 6 minutes) and followed them for a mean of 2.5 years for the primary outcome of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism. Patients with pacemakers were randomly assigned to receive or not to receive continuous atrial overdrive pacing.</fragment>

		<summary>This study demonstrated that maintenance of blood glucose in a liberal range after coronary artery bypass grafting led to similar outcomes compared with a strict target range and was superior in glucose control and target range management.

				<fragment>Between January 2002 and December 2008, 100 patients undergoing mitral valve ± tricuspid valve surgery concomitant with the Maze procedure were randomized into 2 equal groups: the study group using overdrive biatrial pacing and a control group without pacing. One pacing wire was attached to the crista terminalis area of the right atrium, and the other pacing wire was attached to the Bachmann's bundle area located in the roof of the left atrium. The atria were paced continuously in AAI mode at a rate of 80 pulses per minute or 10 pulses above the underlying rate for 5 days. The end points were the onset of recurrent atrial fibrillation or discharge.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Oral anticoagulants are effective at reducing stroke compared with aspirin in atrial fibrillation patients older than 75 years. Although the benefits of reduced stroke risk outweigh the risks of bleeding, the cost effectiveness of warfarin in this patient population has not yet been established.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomized, controlled trial; 973 patients ≥75 years of age with atrial fibrillation were recruited from primary care and randomly assigned to either take warfarin or aspirin. Follow-up was for a mean of 2.7 years. Costs of thrombotic and hemorrhagic events, anticoagulation clinic visits, and primary care utilization were determined. Clinical benefits were expressed in terms of a primary event avoided: fatal/nonfatal disabling stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, or systemic embolism. A cost-utility analysis was performed using quality-adjusted life years as the benefit measure.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Total costs over 4 years were lower in the warfarin group (difference, -£165; 95% CI, -£452-£89), primarily driven by the difference in primary event costs. The primary event rate over 4 years was lower in the warfarin group (0.049 versus 0.099), and the quality-adjusted life years score was higher (difference, 0.02; 95% CI, -0.07-0.11). With lower costs and a higher quality-adjusted life years score, warfarin is the dominant treatment, but the differences in both costs and effects are small.</fragment>

		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Vitamin K antagonists have been shown to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, many patients are not suitable candidates for or are unwilling to receive vitamin K antagonist therapy, and these patients have a high risk of stroke. Apixaban, a novel factor Xa inhibitor, may be an alternative treatment for such patients.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In a double-blind study, we randomly assigned 5599 patients with atrial fibrillation who were at increased risk for stroke and for whom vitamin K antagonist therapy was unsuitable to receive apixaban (at a dose of 5 mg twice daily) or aspirin (81 to 324 mg per day), to determine whether apixaban was superior. The mean follow up period was 1.1 years. The primary outcome was the occurrence of stroke or systemic embolism.</fragment>

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Before enrollment, 40% of the patients had used a vitamin K antagonist. The data and safety monitoring board recommended early termination of the study because of a clear benefit in favor of apixaban.

		<summary>Postoperative atrial fibrillation was reduced by treatment with landiolol hydrochloride. Amelioration of ischemia, an anti-inflammatory effect, and inhibition of sympathetic hypertonia by landiolol presumably reduced the occurrence of atrial fibrillation. Hypotension or bradycardia did not develop in any of the patients, indicating the safety of this beta-blocker. These findings suggest that landiolol hydrochloride could be useful in the perioperative management of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.</summary>

On returning to the intensive care unit, the landiolol group had significantly lower inflammatory and ischemic parameters. Medical costs were also significantly lower in the landiolol group. Multivariate analysis revealed that significant risk factors for atrial fibrillation were a European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation of 10 or more, preoperative non-use of angiotensin receptor blockers, and non-use of landiolol.</fragment>

				<fragment>The risk of bleeding during antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is not homogeneous, and several clinical risk factors have been incorporated into clinical bleeding risk stratification schemas.

			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We investigated predictors of bleeding in a cohort of 7,329 patients with AF participating in the SPORTIF (Stroke Prevention Using an ORal Thrombin Inhibitor in Atrial Fibrillation) III and V clinical trials and evaluated the predictive value of several risk stratification schemas by multivariate analysis. Patients were anticoagulated orally with either adjusted-dose warfarin (target international normalized ratio 2 to 3) or fixed-dose ximelagatran 36 mg twice daily. Major bleeding was centrally adjudicated, and concurrent aspirin therapy was allowed in patients with clinical atherosclerosis.</fragment>

			<section label="CONTEXT" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common, yet there remains an unmet medical need for additional treatment options. Current pharmacological treatments have limited efficacy and significant adverse events. Limited data from small trials suggest omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may provide a safe, effective treatment option for AF patients.</fragment>

				<fragment>At 24 weeks, in the paroxysmal AF stratum, 129 of 269 participants (48%) in the placebo group and 135 of 258 participants (52%) in the prescription group had a recurrent symptomatic AF or flutter event. In the persistent AF stratum, 18 participants (33%) in the placebo group and 32 (50%) in the prescription group had documented symptomatic AF or flutter events. There was no difference between treatment groups for recurrence of symptomatic AF in the paroxysmal stratum (hazard ratio [HR], 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90-1.46; P = .26), in the persistent stratum (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.92-2.92; P = .09), and both strata combined (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.98-1.52; P = .08). Other, secondary end points were supportive of the primary result. A total of 5% of those receiving placebo and 4% of those receiving prescription omega-3 discontinued due to adverse events. Eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid blood levels were significantly higher in the prescription group than in the placebo group at weeks 4 and 24.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>In the Randomised Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY) trial, dabigatran reduced occurrence of both stroke and haemorrhage compared with warfarin in patients who had atrial fibrillation and were at increased risk of stroke.

			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In the RE-LY trial, 18,113 patients from 967 centres in 44 countries were randomly assigned to 110 mg or 150 mg dabigatran twice daily or to warfarin dose adjusted to international normalised ratio 2·0 to 3·0. Median follow-up was 2·0 years (IQR 1·14-2·86), and the primary outcome was stroke or systemic embolism. The primary safety outcome was major haemorrhage. Patients and investigators were aware of whether patients received warfarin or dabigatran, but not of dabigatran dose, and event adjudicators were masked to treatment. In a predefined analysis, we investigated the outcomes of the RE-LY trial in subgroups of patients with or without previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack.

Stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 65 patients (2·78% per year) on warfarin compared with 55 (2·32% per year) on 110 mg dabigatran (relative risk 0·84, 95% CI 0·58-1·20) and 51 (2·07% per year) on 150 mg dabigatran (0·75, 0·52-1·08). The rate of major bleeding was significantly lower in patients on 110 mg dabigatran (RR 0·66, 95% CI 0·48-0·90) and similar in those on 150 mg dabigatran (RR 1·01; 95% CI 0·77-1·34) compared with those on warfarin. The effects of both doses of dabigatran compared with warfarin were not significantly different between patients with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack and those without for any of the outcomes from RE-LY apart from vascular death (110 mg group compared with warfarin group, interaction p=0·038).</fragment>

		<summary>Among patients with acute coronary syndromes or atrial fibrillation, the effect of clopidogrel as compared with placebo is consistent, irrespective of CYP2C19 loss-of-function carrier status.

		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>It has been suggested that clopidogrel may be less effective in reducing the rate of cardiovascular events among persons who are carriers of loss-of-function CYP2C19 alleles that are associated with reduced conversion of clopidogrel to its active metabolite.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We genotyped patients from two large, randomized trials that showed that clopidogrel, as compared with placebo, reduced the rate of cardiovascular events (the primary efficacy outcome) among patients with acute coronary syndromes and among patients with atrial fibrillation. Patients were genotyped for three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (*2, *3, *17) that define the major CYP2C19 alleles.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Among 5059 genotyped patients with acute coronary syndromes, clopidogrel as compared with placebo significantly reduced the rate of the primary efficacy outcome, irrespective of the genetically determined metabolizer phenotype (P=0.12 for heterogeneity). The effect of clopidogrel in reducing the rate of the primary efficacy outcome was similar in patients who were heterozygous or homozygous for loss-of-function alleles and in those who were not carriers of the alleles (rate among carriers, 8.0% with clopidogrel vs. 11.6% with placebo; hazard ratio with clopidogrel, 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.98; rate among noncarriers, 9.5% vs. 13.0%; hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.87). In contrast, gain-of-function carriers derived more benefit from clopidogrel treatment as compared with placebo than did noncarriers (rate of primary outcome among carriers, 7.7% vs. 13.0%; hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.73; rate among noncarriers, 10.0% vs. 12.2%; hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.05; P=0.02 for interaction). The effect of clopidogrel on bleeding did not vary according to genotypic subgroups.

		<summary>Coronary artery disease and smoking are additional risk factors for TE in anticoagulated AF patients, whereas alcohol use appears protective.

		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>The risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is not homogeneous, and various clinical risk factors have informed the development of stroke risk stratification schemes (RSS). Among anticoagulated cohorts, the emphasis should be on the identification of patients who remain at high risk for stroke despite anticoagulation.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We investigated predictors of thromboembolism (TE) risk in an anticoagulated AF clinical trial cohort (n = 7329 subjects) and tested the predictive value of contemporary RSS in this cohort: CHADS₂, Framingham, NICE 2006, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology 2006, the 8th American College of Chest Physicians guidelines and the CHA₂DS₂-VASc schemes.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>On multivariate analysis, significant predictors of TE were stroke/TIA (hazard ratio [HR], 2.24; P &lt; 0.001), age 75 years or older (HR, 1.77; P = 0.0002), coronary artery disease (HR, 1.52; P = 0.0047), and smoking (HR, 2.10; P = 0.0005), whereas reported alcohol use (HR, 0.70; P = 0.02) was protective. Comparison of contemporary RSS demonstrated variable classification of AF patients into risk strata, although c-statistics for TE were broadly similar among the RSS tested and varied between 0.575 (NICE 2006) and 0.647 (CHA₂DS₂-VASc). CHA₂DS₂-VASc classified 94.2% as being at high risk, whereas most other RSS categorized two-thirds as being at high risk. Of the 184 TE events, 181 (98.4%) occurred in patients identified as being at high risk by the CHA₂DS₂-VASc schema. There was a stepwise increase in TE with increasing CHA₂DS₂-VASc score (P (trend) &lt; 0.0001), which had the highest HR (3.75) among the tested schemes. The negative predictive value (ie, the percent categorized as "not high risk" actually being free from TE) for CHA₂DS₂-VASc was 99.5%.</fragment>

		<summary/>
		<content>
			<section>
				<fragment>The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is related to age and is projected to rise exponentially as the population ages and the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors increases. The risk of ischemic stroke is significantly increased in AF patients, and there is evidence of a graded increased risk of stroke associated with advancing age. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is far more effective than antiplatelet agents at reducing stroke risk in patients with AF. Therefore, increasing numbers of elderly patients are candidates for, and could benefit from, the use of anticoagulants. However, elderly people with AF are less likely to receive OAC therapy. This is mainly due to concerns about a higher risk of OAC-associated hemorrhage in the elderly population. Until recently, older patients were under-represented in randomized controlled trials of OAC versus placebo or antiplatelet therapy, and therefore the evidence base for the value of OAC in the elderly population was not known. However, analyses of the available trial data indicate that the expected net clinical benefit of warfarin therapy is highest among patients with the highest untreated risk for stroke, which includes the oldest age category. An important caveat with warfarin treatment is maintenance of a therapeutic international normalized ratio, regardless of the age of the patient, where time in therapeutic range should be &gt; or =65%. Therefore, age alone should not prevent prescription of OAC in elderly patients, given an appropriate stroke and bleeding risk stratification.</fragment>

				<fragment>Antiarrhythmic drugs are commonly used for prevention of recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF) despite inconsistent efficacy and frequent adverse effects. Catheter ablation has been proposed as an alternative treatment for paroxysmal AF.</fragment>

			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>To determine the efficacy of catheter ablation compared with antiarrhythmic drug therapy (ADT) in treating symptomatic paroxysmal AF.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A prospective, multicenter, randomized (2:1), unblinded, Bayesian-designed study conducted at 19 hospitals of 167 patients who did not respond to at least 1 antiarrhythmic drug and who experienced at least 3 AF episodes within 6 months before randomization. Enrollment occurred between October 25, 2004, and October 11, 2007, with the last follow-up on January 19, 2009.</fragment>

			<section label="INTERVENTION" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Catheter ablation (n = 106) or ADT (n = 61), with assessment for effectiveness in a comparable 9-month follow-up period.</fragment>

			<section label="MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Time to protocol-defined treatment failure. The proportion of patients who experienced major treatment-related adverse events within 30 days of catheter ablation or ADT was also reported.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>At the end of the 9-month effectiveness evaluation period, 66% of patients in the catheter ablation group remained free from protocol-defined treatment failure compared with 16% of patients treated with ADT. The hazard ratio of catheter ablation to ADT was 0.30 (95% confidence interval, 0.19-0.47; P &lt; .001). Major 30-day treatment-related adverse events occurred in 5 of 57 patients (8.8%) treated with ADT and 5 of 103 patients (4.9%) treated with catheter ablation. Mean quality of life scores improved significantly in patients treated by catheter ablation compared with ADT at 3 months; improvement was maintained during the course of the study.</fragment>

			<section label="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>Among patients with paroxysmal AF who had not responded to at least 1 antiarrhythmic drug, the use of catheter ablation compared with ADT resulted in a longer time to treatment failure during the 9-month follow-up period.</fragment>

To be eligible, patients also had to have underlying cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or left atrial enlargement. Patients were randomly assigned to receive valsartan or placebo.

				<fragment>Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) often coexist. The aim was to investigate whether restoring sinus rhythm (SR) could improve cardiac function, symptoms, exercise capacity and quality of life (QoL) in patients with chronic heart failure.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Patients with HF and persistent AF receiving guideline-recommended treatments, including anticoagulants, were eligible for the study. Patients were randomised to either rhythm (treated with amiodarone for at least 3 months prior to attempting biphasic external cardioversion and continued amiodarone long-term if SR was restored) or rate control. Anticoagulants were continued throughout the study regardless of rhythm, unless contraindications developed. Both groups were treated with beta blockers and/or digoxin to reduce the heart rate to &lt;80 bpm at rest and &lt;110 bpm after walking. Symptoms, walk distance (6-minute corridor walk test, 6MWT), QoL and cardiac function were assessed at baseline and 1 year.</fragment>

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>61 patients with HF and persistent AF (median duration 14 months (IQR 5 to 32)) were randomly assigned to a rate or rhythm control strategy. Of patients assigned to rhythm control (n = 30), 66% were in SR at 1 year, and 90% of those assigned to rate control (n = 31) achieved the heart rate target. At 1 year, NYHA class (p = 0.424) and 6MWT distance (p = 0.342) were similar between groups but patients assigned to rhythm control had improved LV function (p = 0.014), NT-proBNP concentration (p = 0.046) and QoL (p = 0.019) compared with those assigned to rate control. Greatest improvement was seen in patients in whom SR was maintained.</fragment>

One hundred sixty-eight patients were randomized, 167 received study treatment, and 159 were included in perprotocol analyses. The mean duration of current AF episode was 47 days (range, 0.8-92). In the AZD7009 30-minute 3.25 mg/min group, 21 of 42 patients converted within 90 minutes, compared with 7 of 39, 7 of 36, and 0 of 42 patients in the 15-minute 3.25 mg/min, 15-minute 4.4 mg/min, and combined placebo groups, respectively. Patients not converted within 90 minutes underwent DC cardioversion. In patients with AF episodes &lt;/=30 days, conversion rates with AZD7009 30-minute 3.25 mg/min and after placebo followed by DC cardioversion were 82% and 83%, respectively. AZD7009 was generally well tolerated. Mean QTc increased by 15% to 20% in the AZD7009 treatment groups. One patient experienced a ventricular tachyarrhythmia of 7 beats, with features of torsades de pointes. AZD7009 was associated with a 50% conversion rate in the best-dose group. In patients with AF episodes &lt;or=30 days, the conversion rates after AZD1305 and placebo followed by DC cardioversion were observed to be similar.</fragment>

		<summary>Among healthy middle-aged women, consumption of up to 2 alcoholic beverages per day was not associated with an increased risk of incident atrial fibrillation. Heavier consumption of 2 or more drinks per day, however, was associated with a small but statistically significant increased risk of atrial fibrillation.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="CONTEXT" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Previous studies suggest that consuming moderate to high amounts of alcohol on a regular basis might increase the risk of developing atrial fibrillation in men but not in women. However, these studies were not powered to investigate the association of alcohol consumption and atrial fibrillation among women.</fragment>

			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>To prospectively assess the association between regular alcohol consumption and incident atrial fibrillation among women.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Participants were 34 715 initially healthy women participating in the Women's Health Study, a completed randomized controlled trial conducted in the United States. Participants were older than 45 years and free of atrial fibrillation at baseline and underwent prospective follow-up from 1993 to October 31, 2006. Alcohol consumption was assessed via questionnaires at baseline and at 48 months of follow-up and was grouped into 4 categories (0, &gt; 0 and &lt; 1, &gt; or = 1 and &lt; 2, and &gt; or = 2 drinks per day). Atrial fibrillation was self-reported on the yearly questionnaires and subsequently confirmed by electrocardiogram and medical record review.</fragment>

				<fragment>Over a median follow-up of 12.4 years, 653 cases of incident atrial fibrillation were confirmed. Age-adjusted incidences among women consuming 0 (n = 15,370), more than 0 and less than 1 (n = 15,758), 1 or more and less than 2 (n = 2228), and 2 or more (n = 1359) drinks per day were 1.59, 1.55, 1.27, and 2.25 events/1000 person-years of follow-up. Thus, compared with nondrinking women, women consuming 2 or more drinks per day had an absolute risk increase of 0.66 events/1000 person-years. The corresponding multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for incident atrial fibrillation were 1, 1.05 (95% CI, 0.88-1.25), 0.84 (95% CI, 0.58-1.22), and 1.60 (95% CI, 1.13-2.25), respectively. The increased hazard in the small group of women consuming 2 or more drinks per day persisted when alcohol intake was updated at 48 months (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.05-2.11) or when women were censored at their first cardiovascular event (HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.18-2.39).</fragment>

				<fragment>Beta-adrenergic stimulation may increase heart rate and the potential for cardiac arrhythmias. The effect of inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) on these outcomes was evaluated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 2 double-blind randomized clinical trials. The pretreatment arrhythmia occurrence frequency in these patients was also described. In this analysis, 24-hour Holter monitoring data were pooled from 2 identically designed Phase III trials. Patients were randomized to LABA treatment or placebo for 12 weeks: a) nebulized arformoterol 15 microg BID, b) 25 microg BID, or c) 50 microg QD; d) salmeterol metered dose inhaler 42 microg BID; or e) placebo. The 24-hour Holter monitoring was performed pretreatment and at Weeks 0 (first day of dosing), 6, and 12. We assessed the proportion of patients with each of 4 arrhythmias: atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and "nonsustained"; (4-10 beats) and "sustained"; (&gt;10 beats) ventricular tachycardia. There were 5226 Holter recordings in 1429 treated patients. At baseline, there was a low frequency of occurrence of atrial fibrillation/flutter (0.1%), nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (3.1%), and &gt;10 beat ventricular tachycardia (0.3%). Atrial tachycardia occurred frequently (41.8%). The proportion of patients with treatment-emergent atrial tachycardia ranged from 27% to 32% and was non-significantly higher, by approximately 2%-5% (p = 0.70), in the LABA groups compared with the placebo group. The rates of the other more serious arrhythmias did not increase with LABA treatment and were similar to placebo. All treatment groups (LABA and placebo) had consistent small decreases from baseline in mean 24-hour and maximum hourly heart rate. In conclusion, in this large cohort of COPD patients with no or stable cardiac comorbidities, a high proportion ( approximately 40%) of patients were observed to have atrial tachycardia before treatment, which increased by 2%-5% with LABA treatment. More serious arrhythmias were infrequent and did not increase with inhaled LABA therapy. LABA administration did not increase mean heart rate.</fragment>

All patients completed the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire (scores range from 0 to 105, with a higher score indicating a worse quality of life) and underwent echocardiography and a 6-minute walk test (the composite primary end point). Over a 6-month period, patients were monitored for both symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes of atrial fibrillation.</fragment>

				<fragment>In all, 41 patients underwent pulmonary-vein isolation, and 40 underwent atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing; none were lost to follow-up at 6 months. The composite primary end point favored the group that underwent pulmonary-vein isolation, with an improved questionnaire score at 6 months (60, vs. 82 in the group that underwent atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing; P&lt;0.001), a longer 6-minute-walk distance (340 m vs. 297 m, P&lt;0.001), and a higher ejection fraction (35% vs. 28%, P&lt;0.001). In the group that underwent pulmonary-vein isolation, 88% of patients receiving antiarrhythmic drugs and 71% of those not receiving such drugs were free of atrial fibrillation at 6 months. In the group that underwent pulmonary-vein isolation, pulmonary-vein stenosis developed in two patients, pericardial effusion in one, and pulmonary edema in another; in the group that underwent atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing, lead dislodgment was found in one patient and pneumothorax in another.</fragment>

		<summary/>
		<content>
			<section>
				<fragment>Vernakalant hydrochloride injection (RSD1235) is a relatively atrial-selective antiarrhythmic agent that converts atrial fibrillation rapidly to sinus rhythm. The pharmacokinetics of vernakalant were explored in healthy volunteers and in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in 4 clinical studies. Key pharmacokinetic parameters analyzed were the maximum plasma concentration and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve. Vernakalant exhibited linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 0.1 mg/kg to 5.0 mg/kg in healthy subjects, and generally showed dose proportionality in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter who received 1 or 2 vernakalant infusions. Vernakalant was metabolized rapidly via 4-O-demethylation by cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 to its major metabolite RSD1385, which then circulated predominantly as an inactive glucuronide conjugate. In most patients, the maximum plasma concentration of RSD1385 glucuronide exceeded that of vernakalant. Unconjugated RSD1385 was found at low levels in all patients demonstrating either a cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 "extensive metabolizer" or "poor metabolizer" phenotype or genotype; however, CYP2D6 poor metabolizers had even lower levels of unconjugated RSD1385. The impact of CYP2D6 metabolizer status on vernakalant exposure was explored in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter who received a therapeutic regimen (3 mg/kg initially via 10-minute intravenous infusion followed by a second 2 mg/kg 10-minute infusion if atrial fibrillation persisted after a 15-minute observation period). In the subset that received 2 vernakalant infusions, there was little difference in vernakalant maximum plasma concentration or area under the plasma concentration-time curve from the start of the first infusion to 90 minutes between CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers or between those who did or did not receive concomitant CYP2D6-inhibitor medications. Gender, age, and renal function did not have a clinically significant influence on the pharmacokinetics of vernakalant. These results suggest that an assessment of CYP2D6 expression may not be needed when vernakalant is administered acutely and intravenously to patients with atrial fibrillation.</fragment>
