			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Right ventricular pacing restores an adequate heart rate in patients with atrioventricular block, but high percentages of right ventricular apical pacing may promote left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

		<updated>2013-04-17</updated>
		<summary>Among patients with postinfarction chronic heart failure, shock wave-facilitated intracoronary administration of BMCs vs shock wave treatment alone resulted in a significant, albeit modest, improvement in LVEF at 4 months. Determining whether the increase in contractile function will translate into improved clinical outcomes requires confirmation in larger clinical end point trials.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="IMPORTANCE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>The modest effects of clinical studies using intracoronary administration of autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMCs) in patients with chronic postinfarction heart failure may be attributed to impaired homing of BMCs to the target area. Extracorporeal shock wave treatment has been experimentally shown to increase homing factors in the target tissue, resulting in enhanced retention of applied BMCs.</fragment>

			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>To test the hypothesis that targeted cardiac shock wave pretreatment with subsequent application of BMCs improves recovery of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with chronic heart failure.</fragment>

				<fragment>Diastolic function (E/e') decreased from 12.7 (SD, 3.6) to 12.1 (SD, 3.7) with spironolactone and increased from 12.8 (SD, 4.4) to 13.6 (SD, 4.3) with placebo (adjusted mean difference, -1.5; 95% CI, -2.0 to -0.9; P &lt; .001).

			<section>
				<fragment>For a majority of patients with advanced heart failure, there is a need for complementary, non-pharmacologic interventions that could be easily implemented by health care providers to provide palliative care. Three major pathologic pathways underlying heart failure symptoms have been identified: fluid overload, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Prior research has demonstrated that three nutrients-sodium, omega-3 fatty acids, and lycopene-can alter these pathologic pathways. Therefore, the purposes of this study are to test the effects of a 6-month nutrition intervention of dietary sodium reduction combined with supplementation of lycopene and omega-3 fatty acids on heart failure symptoms, health-related quality of life, and time to heart failure rehospitalization or all-cause death. The aims of this double blind-placebo controlled study are (1) to determine the effects of a 6-month nutrition intervention on symptom burden (edema, shortness of air, and fatigue) and health-related quality of life at 3 and 6 months, and time to heart failure rehospitalization or all-cause death over 12 months from baseline; (2) compare dietary sodium intake, inflammation, and markers of oxidative stress between the nutrition intervention group and a placebo group at 3 and 6 months; and (3) compare body weight, serum lycopene, and erythrocyte omega-3 index between the nutrition intervention group and a placebo group at 3 and 6 months. A total of 175 patients with advanced heart failure will be randomized to either the nutrition intervention or placebo group.</fragment>

				<fragment>Per-site enrollment ranged from 0 to 75 (median 6; 77 sites had no enrollment). Regional differences in enrollment were noted between North and South America, and Western and Eastern Europe (p &lt; 0.001). Participants from sites with fewer enrollments were more likely to be older and male, have lower ejection fraction and blood pressure as well as worse comorbidity and laboratory profile, and were less likely to be on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or aldosterone antagonists. During a median follow-up of 9.9 months, 1,700 (41%) participants had an outcome event. Compared to event rate at sites with &gt;30 participants (32%), those with 1 to 10 (51%, hazard ratio [HR]: 1.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.56 to 2.02) and 11 to 30 (42%, HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.28 to 1.62) participants per site groups had worse outcomes. This relationship was comparable across regions (p = 0.43).

		<summary>Treatment of acute heart failure with serelaxin was associated with dyspnoea relief and improvement in other clinical outcomes, but had no effect on readmission to hospital. Serelaxin treatment was well tolerated and safe, supported by the reduced 180-day mortality.</summary>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Serelaxin, recombinant human relaxin-2, is a vasoactive peptide hormone with many biological and haemodynamic effects. In a pilot study, serelaxin was safe and well tolerated with positive clinical outcome signals in patients with acute heart failure. The RELAX-AHF trial tested the hypothesis that serelaxin-treated patients would have greater dyspnoea relief compared with patients treated with standard care and placebo.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>RELAX-AHF was an international, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, enrolling patients admitted to hospital for acute heart failure who were randomly assigned (1:1) via a central randomisation scheme blocked by study centre to standard care plus 48-h intravenous infusions of placebo or serelaxin (30 μg/kg per day) within 16 h from presentation. All patients had dyspnoea, congestion on chest radiograph, increased brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal prohormone of BNP, mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency, and systolic blood pressure greater than 125 mm Hg. Patients, personnel administering study drug, and those undertaking study-related assessments were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoints evaluating dyspnoea improvement were change from baseline in the visual analogue scale area under the curve (VAS AUC) to day 5 and the proportion of patients with moderate or marked dyspnoea improvement measured by Likert scale during the first 24 h, both analysed by intention to treat.

		<summary>In a randomized trial involving patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure, worsened renal function, and persistent congestion, the use of a stepped pharmacologic-therapy algorithm was superior to a strategy of ultrafiltration for the preservation of renal function at 96 hours, with a similar amount of weight loss with the two approaches.

				<fragment>Ultrafiltration was inferior to pharmacologic therapy with respect to the bivariate end point of the change in the serum creatinine level and body weight 96 hours after enrollment (P=0.003), owing primarily to an increase in the creatinine level in the ultrafiltration group. At 96 hours, the mean change in the creatinine level was -0.04±0.53 mg per deciliter (-3.5±46.9 μmol per liter) in the pharmacologic-therapy group, as compared with +0.23±0.70 mg per deciliter (20.3±61.9 μmol per liter) in the ultrafiltration group (P=0.003).

		<summary>In this pilot proof of concept study, chronic protein therapy with SC BNP improved LV remodeling, LV filling pressure, and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure score in patients with stable systolic HF on optimal therapy.

		<summary>In patients with chronic systolic HF, volume of exercise is associated with the risk for clinical events, with only moderate levels (3 to 7 MET-h per week) of exercise needed to observe a clinical benefit. Although further study is warranted to confirm the relationship between volume of exercise completed and clinical events, our findings support the use of regular exercise in the management of these patients.</summary>

		<content>
			<section label="PURPOSE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Cardiac dysfunction (CD) is a recognized risk associated with the addition of trastuzumab to adjuvant chemotherapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer, especially when the treatment regimen includes anthracyclines. Given the demonstrated efficacy of trastuzumab, ongoing assessment of cardiac safety and identification of risk factors for CD are important for optimal patient care.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="PATIENTS AND METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-31, a phase III adjuvant trial, 1,830 patients who met eligibility criteria for initiation of trastuzumab were evaluated for CD. Recovery from CD was also assessed. A statistical model was developed to estimate the risk of severe congestive heart failure (CHF). Baseline patient characteristics associated with anthracycline-related decline in cardiac function were also identified.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>At 7-year follow-up, 37 (4.0%) of 944 patients who received trastuzumab experienced a cardiac event (CE) versus 10 (1.3%) of 743 patients in the control arm. One cardiac-related death has occurred in each arm of the protocol. A Cardiac Risk Score, calculated using patient age and baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by multiple-gated acquisition scan, statistically correlates with the risk of a CE. After stopping trastuzumab, the majority of patients who experienced CD recovered LVEF in the normal range, although some decline from baseline often persists. Only two CEs occurred more than 2 years after initiation of trastuzumab.</fragment>

				<fragment>The original trial enrolled 314 patients with heart failure who were aged 50 years or older and were taking at least one cardiovascular drug for heart failure; 122 patients received the pharmacist intervention (patient education, therapeutic monitoring, and communication with primary care providers), and 192 patients received usual care (regular follow-up with primary care providers). We analyzed the results of 281 patients who had available health literacy and adherence data.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Drug adherence was assessed over 9 months using electronic prescription container monitors on cardiovascular drugs. Health literacy was assessed using the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (scores range from 0-36, with an adequate literacy score defined as ≥ 23). Taking adherence, defined as the percentage of prescribed drug doses taken by the patient compared with the number of doses prescribed by the physician, was assessed for each group. Patients were a mean ± SD of 63 ± 9 years old, 51% had less than 12 years of education, 29% had inadequate health literacy, and they received a mean ± SD of 11 ± 4 drugs. In the usual care group, taking adherence was greater among patients with adequate (69.4%) than those with inadequate (54.2%) health literacy (p=0.001). In the intervention group, the difference in taking adherence among patients with adequate (77.3%) and inadequate (65.3%) health literacy was not statistically significant (p=0.06). Among patients with inadequate health literacy, the intervention increased adherence (65%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 54-77%) by an order of magnitude similar to that of the baseline adherence of patients with adequate health literacy (69%, 95% CI 65-74%).

				<fragment>The incidence of the primary endpoint--a composite of 30-day mortality, perioperative myocardial infarction, and left ventricular heart failure at weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass-was 7.3% versus 5.8% (P = .41) in the glutamate and control groups, respectively. Patients with left ventricular failure at weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass had a shorter median intensive care unit stay (25 vs 92 hours; P = .02) if they were treated with glutamate. In patients with unstable angina (Canadian Cardiovascular Society class IV) undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 458), the incidence of severe circulatory failure according to the prespecified criteria was significantly lower in the glutamate group (1.3% vs 6.9%; P = .004). On multivariate analysis, glutamate infusion was associated with a reduced risk of developing severe circulatory failure (odds ratio, 0.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.72; P = .02). A relative risk reduction exceeding 50% for developing severe circulatory failure was seen in most risk groups undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting, with those with diabetes a notable exception.</fragment>

We followed 2305 patients for up to 6 years (mean [±SD], 3.5±1.8).

Thus, there was no significant overall difference between the two treatments. In a time-varying analysis, the hazard ratio changed over time, slightly favoring warfarin over aspirin by the fourth year of follow-up, but this finding was only marginally significant (P=0.046).

				<fragment>A total of 220 patients scheduled for CRT underwent baseline echocardiographic speckle-tracking 2-dimensional radial strain imaging and were then randomized 1:1 into 2 groups.

In group 2 (control) patients underwent standard unguided CRT. Patients were classified by the relationship of the LV lead to the optimal site as concordant (at optimal site), adjacent (within 1 segment), or remote (≥2 segments away).

			<section>
				<fragment>Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is present in 69% of patients with a first myocardial infarction, in 77% of patients with a first stroke, in 74% of patients with chronic heart failure, and in 60% of patients with peripheral arterial disease. Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that antihypertensive drug therapy reduces cardiovascular events in patients aged 65 to 79 years. In the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial, patients aged ≥ 80 years who were treated with antihypertensive drug therapy had, at 1.8-year follow-up, a 30% reduction in fatal or nonfatal stroke (P = 0.06), a 39% reduction in fatal stroke (P = 0.05), a 21% reduction in all-cause mortality (P = 0.02), a 23% reduction in cardiovascular death (P = 0.06), and a 64% reduction in heart failure (P &lt; 0.001). Although the optimal blood pressure (BP) treatment goal in the elderly has not been determined, existing epidemiologic and clinical trial data suggest that a reasonable therapeutic BP goal should be &lt; 140/90 mm Hg in persons aged &lt; 80 years and a systolic BP of 140 to 145 mm Hg if tolerated in persons aged ≥ 80 years. Nonpharmacologic lifestyle measures should be encouraged both to prevent development of hypertension and as adjunctive therapy in persons with hypertension. Diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, and calcium channel blockers have all shown benefit in reducing cardiovascular events in randomized trials. The choice of specific drugs depends on efficacy, tolerability, presence of specific comorbidities, and cost. Adverse effects from treatment, such as electrolyte disturbances, renal dysfunction, and excessive orthostatic BP reduction, should be avoided.</fragment>

		<summary>These initial results in patients are very encouraging.

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>c-kit-positive, lineage-negative cardiac stem cells (CSCs) improve post-infarction left ventricular (LV) dysfunction when administered to animals. We undertook a phase 1 trial (Stem Cell Infusion in Patients with Ischemic cardiOmyopathy [SCIPIO]) of autologous CSCs for the treatment of heart failure resulting from ischaemic heart disease.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In stage A of the SCIPIO trial, patients with post-infarction LV dysfunction (ejection fraction [EF] ≤40%) before coronary artery bypass grafting were consecutively enrolled in the treatment and control groups. In stage B, patients were randomly assigned to the treatment or control group in a 2:3 ratio by use of a computer-generated block randomisation scheme. 1 million autologous CSCs were administered by intracoronary infusion at a mean of 113 days (SE 4) after surgery; controls were not given any treatment. Although the study was open label, the echocardiographic analyses were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was short-term safety of CSCs and the secondary endpoint was efficacy. A per-protocol analysis was used. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00474461.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>This study is still in progress. 16 patients were assigned to the treatment group and seven to the control group; no CSC-related adverse effects were reported. In 14 CSC-treated patients who were analysed, LVEF increased from 30·3% (SE 1·9) before CSC infusion to 38·5% (2·8) at 4 months after infusion (p=0·001). By contrast, in seven control patients, during the corresponding time interval, LVEF did not change (30·1% [2·4] at 4 months after CABG vs 30·2% [2·5] at 8 months after CABG). Importantly, the salubrious effects of CSCs were even more pronounced at 1 year in eight patients (eg, LVEF increased by 12·3 ejection fraction units [2·1] vs baseline, p=0·0007). In the seven treated patients in whom cardiac MRI could be done, infarct size decreased from 32·6 g (6·3) by 7·8 g (1·7; 24%) at 4 months (p=0·004) and 9·8 g (3·5; 30%) at 1 year (p=0·04).</fragment>

				<fragment>Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) is a randomized trial determining whether intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) aimed at long-term weight loss and increased physical fitness reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes compared to control (diabetes support and education, DSE). We investigated the correlates of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), a biomarker associated with heart failure (HF) risk, in a subsample from 15 of 16 participating centers and tested the hypothesis that ILI decreased NT-proBNP levels. Baseline and 1-year blood samples were assayed for NT-proBNP in a random sample of 1,500 without, and all 628 with, self-reported baseline CVD (cardiovascular disease) (N = 2,128). Linear models were used to assess relationships that log-transformed NT-proBNP had with CVD risk factors at baseline and that 1-year changes in NT-proBNP had with intervention assignment. At baseline, the mean (s.d.) age, BMI, and hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) were 59.6 (6.8) years, 36.0 kg/m(2) (5.8), and 7.2% (1.1), respectively. Baseline geometric mean NT-proBNP was not different by condition (ILI 53.3 vs. DSE 51.5, P = 0.45), was not associated with BMI, and was inversely associated with HbA(1c). At 1 year, ILI participants achieved an average weight loss of 8.3% compared to 0.7% in DSE. At 1 year, NT-proBNP levels increased to a greater extent in the intervention arm (ILI +21.3% vs. DSE +14.2%, P = 0.046). The increased NT-proBNP associated with ILI was correlated with changes in HbA(1c), BMI, and body composition. In conclusion, among overweight and obese persons with diabetes, an ILI that reduced weight was associated with an increased NT-proBNP.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Many patients with heart failure remain symptomatic and have a poor prognosis despite existing treatments. Decreases in myocardial contractility and shortening of ventricular systole are characteristic of systolic heart failure and might be improved by a new therapeutic class, cardiac myosin activators. We report the first study of the cardiac myosin activator, omecamtiv mecarbil, in patients with systolic heart failure.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We undertook a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial investigating the effects of omecamtiv mecarbil (formerly CK-1827452), given intravenously for 2, 24, or 72 h to patients with stable heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction receiving guideline-indicated treatment. Clinical assessment (including vital signs, echocardiograms, and electrocardiographs) and testing of plasma drug concentrations took place during and after completion of each infusion. The primary aim was to assess safety and tolerability of omecamtiv mecarbil. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00624442.</fragment>

			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>45 patients received 151 infusions of active drug or placebo. Placebo-corrected, concentration-dependent increases in left ventricular ejection time (up to an 80 ms increase from baseline) and stroke volume (up to 9·7 mL) were recorded, associated with a small reduction in heart rate (up to 2·7 beats per min; p&lt;0·0001 for all three measures). Higher plasma concentrations were also associated with reductions in end-systolic (decrease of 15 mL at &gt;500 ng/mL, p=0·0026) and end-diastolic volumes (16 mL, p=0·0096) that might have been more pronounced with increased duration of infusion. Cardiac ischaemia emerged at high plasma concentrations (two patients, plasma concentrations roughly 1750 ng/mL and 1350 ng/mL).

			<section>
				<fragment>Exercise training in patients with systolic heart failure (HF) is an accepted adjunct to an evidence-based management program. This review describes the pathophysiologic features that are thought to be responsible for the exercise intolerance experienced in the HF patient. Significant research has expanded our appreciation of the interplay of hemodynamic, ventilatory, and skeletal myopathic processes in this common, chronic condition. Randomized, controlled exercise trials designed to measure endothelial function, inflammatory markers, sympathetic neural activation, and skeletal muscle metabolism and structure have further defined the pathophysiology, documented the impact of exercise training on these processes, and confirmed the benefit of this therapy. Consistent with prior clinical research and patient experience are the recently published results of the HF-ACTION (Heart Failure-A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of exercise TraiNing), which demonstrated a modest improvement in exercise capacity, reduction of symptoms, and improved self-reported measures of quality of life without adverse events. Consideration is given in this review to the benefits of variable intensity programs and the addition of resistance exercise to a standard aerobic prescription. Despite increasing validation of the role exercise training plays in the modification of exercise intolerance, challenges remain in its routine therapeutic application, including acceptance and use as an adjunctive intervention in the management of the patient with HF, limited insurance coverage for HF patients in cardiac rehabilitation, tailoring of exercise programs to best address the needs of subgroups of patients, and improved short- and long-term adherence to exercise training and a physically active lifestyle.</fragment>

				<fragment>From November 2006 to June 2009, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to test the efficacy and safety of CABG for multivessel coronary artery disease combined with autologous BMMNCs in patients with congestive heart failure due to severe ischemic cardiomyopathy. Sixty-five patients were recruited, and 60 patients remained in the final trial and were randomized to a CABG + BMMNC group (n = 31) and a placebo-control group (i.e., CABG-only group, n = 29). All patients discharged received a 6-month follow-up.

		<content>
			<section>
				<fragment>Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an integral component of modern heart failure therapy for patients with severe symptoms (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III or IV), a reduced ejection fraction (≤ 35%), and a wide QRS complex (&gt; 120 ms). Results from recent trials have provided ample evidence that CRT may also reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with mildly symptomatic heart failure (NYHA class II). As a result, the 2010 European guidelines now recommend CRT for this patient population (level of evidence I, class A). This review summarizes and critically evaluates the landmark Resynchronization Reverses Remodeling in Systolic Left Ventricular Dysfunction (REVERSE), Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial with Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (MADIT-CRT), and Resynchronization/Defibrillation for Ambulatory Heart Failure Trial (RAFT) studies, which comprise the suite of randomized controlled trials available today on this matter. Furthermore, we discuss the rationale and available evidence for other emerging indications for CRT, including its use in patients with a mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (&gt; 35%), in those with a narrow QRS complex (≤ 130 ms), or in patients with concomitant bradyarrhythmic pacemaker indications.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Many patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), a common condition with high morbidity and mortality rates, receive treatment in primary care. To improve the management of CHF in primary care, we developed an implementation programme comprised of educational and organisational components, with support by a practice visitor and focus both on drug treatment and lifestyle advice, and on organisation of care within the practice and collaboration with other healthcare providers. Tailoring has been shown to improve the success of implementation programmes, but little is known about what would be best methods for tailoring, specifically with respect to CHF in primary care.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS/DESIGN" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We describe the study protocol of a cluster randomised controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of tailoring a CHF implementation programme to general practices compared to a standardised way of delivering a programme. The study population will consist of 60 general practitioners (GPs) and the CHF patients they include. GPs are randomised in blocks of four, stratified according to practice size. With a tailored implementation programme GPs prioritise the issues that will form the bases of the support for the practice visits. These may comprise several issues, both educational and organizational.The primary outcome measures are patient's experience of receiving structured primary care for CHF (PACIC, a questionnaire related to the Chronic Care Model), patients' health-related utilities (EQ-5D), and drugs prescriptions using the guideline adherence index. Patients being clustered in practices, multilevel regression analyses will be used to explore the effect of practice size and type of intervention programme. In addition we will examine both changes within groups and differences at follow-up between groups with respect to drug dosages and advice on lifestyle issues. Furthermore, in interviews the feasibility of the programme and goal attainment, organisational changes in CHF care, and formalised cooperation with other disciplines will be assessed.</fragment>

			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>To assess the cardiovascular prognostic value of mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM) and compare this with B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), on death or a composite end point in patients who developed heart failure after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI).</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>From a subset of 214 patients from the OPTIMAAL study, blood samples were obtained at a median of 3 days after AMI when patients had developed signs and/or symptoms of heart failure (HF) or a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;0.35%. End points were all-cause mortality and a composite end point, including death, myocardial reinfarction, stroke and/or resuscitated cardiac arrest.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Mean age of the patients was 68±10 years and mean follow-up was 918±311 days. During follow-up 31 patients died and 61 reached the composite end point. In multivariable Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for BNP, NT-proBNP and other covariates, a doubling of MR-proADM showed a 3.02 (95% CI 1.66 to 5.49) times increased risk of mortality (p&lt;0.001) and a 1.77 (95% CI 1.13 to 2.78) times increased risk of reaching the composite end point (p=0.013). Receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that MR-proADM (area under the curve (AUC)=0.81) was a stronger predictor of mortality than BNP (AUC=0.66; p=0.0034 vs MR-proADM) and NT-proBNP (AUC=0.67; p&lt;0.001 vs MR-proADM). Furthermore, MR-proADM enhanced significantly risk classification and integrated discrimination improvement in comparison with BNP and NT-proBNP. Finally, changes in MR-proADM over time significantly added prognostic information to the baseline value.</fragment>

				<fragment>The risk of cardiovascular events among patients with atrial fibrillation is high. We evaluated whether irbesartan, an angiotensin-receptor blocker, would reduce this risk.</fragment>

				<fragment>We randomly assigned patients with a history of risk factors for stroke and a systolic blood pressure of at least 110 mm Hg to receive either irbesartan at a target dose of 300 mg once daily or double-blind placebo. These patients were already enrolled in one of two trials (of clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone or versus oral anticoagulants). The first coprimary outcome was stroke, myocardial infarction, or death from vascular causes; the second was this composite outcome plus hospitalization for heart failure.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>A total of 9016 patients were enrolled and followed for a mean of 4.1 years. The mean reduction in systolic blood pressure was 2.9 mm Hg greater in the irbesartan group than in the placebo group, and the mean reduction in diastolic blood pressure was 1.9 mm Hg greater. The first coprimary outcome occurred at a rate of 5.4% per 100 person-years in both groups (hazard ratio with irbesartan, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 1.08; P=0.85). The second coprimary outcome occurred at a rate of 7.3% per 100 person-years among patients receiving irbesartan and 7.7% per 100 person-years among patients receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.02; P=0.12). The rates of first hospitalization for heart failure (a prespecified secondary outcome) were 2.7% per 100 person-years among patients receiving irbesartan and 3.2% per 100 person-years among patients receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.98). Among patients who were in sinus rhythm at baseline, there was no benefit of irbesartan in preventing hospitalization for atrial fibrillation or atrial fibrillation recorded on 12-lead electrocardiography, nor was there a benefit in a subgroup that underwent transtelephonic monitoring.

		<summary>In patients with symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis undergoing aortic valve replacement, left atrial volume provides important prognostic information beyond standard risk factors.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>One of the hemodynamic consequences of aortic valve stenosis is pressure overload leading to left atrial dilatation. Left atrial size is a known risk factor providing prognostic information in several cardiac conditions. It is not known if this is also the case in patients with aortic valve stenosis after aortic valve replacement.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A total of 119 patients with severe aortic valve stenosis scheduled for aortic valve replacement were evaluated preoperatively and divided into 2 groups according to left atrial volume index (≥40 mL/m(2)). Echocardiography was repeated 12 months after surgery. Patients were followed up for 24 months. The primary end point was the composite end point overall mortality and hospitalization due to congestive heart failure.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Preoperative left atrial dilation was associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and increased filling pressure. Preoperative left atrial volume index was associated with persistent abnormalities in left ventricular filling pressure and left ventricular mass index at 1 year after surgery. Event-free survival in patients with left atrial volume index of 40 mL/m(2) or more at 1 year was 71% compared with 88% in patients with left atrial volume index less than 40 mL/m(2) (P = .002). Patients with preoperative increased E/e' ratio and left ventricular hypertrophy were at increased risk. In Cox regression analysis after correcting for standard risk factors, left atrial volume index was found to be the only significant predictor of the composite end point. In a forward conditional multivariable model, left atrial volume index 40 mL/m(2) or greater (hazard ratio, 4.2 [1.6-10.7]; P = .003) remained an independent predictor, whereas E/e' was borderline significant (P = .06).</fragment>

		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Results of previous studies support the hypothesis that implantable haemodynamic monitoring systems might reduce rates of hospitalisation in patients with heart failure. We undertook a single-blind trial to assess this approach.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III heart failure, irrespective of the left ventricular ejection fraction, and a previous hospital admission for heart failure were enrolled in 64 centres in the USA. They were randomly assigned by use of a centralised electronic system to management with a wireless implantable haemodynamic monitoring (W-IHM) system (treatment group) or to a control group for at least 6 months. Only patients were masked to their assignment group. In the treatment group, clinicians used daily measurement of pulmonary artery pressures in addition to standard of care versus standard of care alone in the control group. The primary efficacy endpoint was the rate of heart-failure-related hospitalisations at 6 months. The safety endpoints assessed at 6 months were freedom from device-related or system-related complications (DSRC) and freedom from pressure-sensor failures. All analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00531661.</fragment>

		<summary>This study demonstrates long-term improvement in left ventricular structure and function after mitral valve surgery for up to 5 years. These data provide evidence supporting mitral valve repair in combination with the Acorn CorCap device for patients with nonischemic heart failure with severe left ventricular dysfunction who have been medically optimized yet remain symptomatic with significant mitral regurgitation.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>The study objective was to evaluate the long-term (5-year) safety and efficacy of mitral valve surgery with and without the CorCap cardiac support device (Acorn Cardiovascular, St Paul, Minn) in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and New York Heart Association class II-IV heart failure.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>The Acorn trial provided a unique opportunity to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of mitral valve surgery because clinical visits and echocardiograms (read by a core laboratory) were completed for 5 years of follow-up. Further, this study provided follow-up data on the long-term effect of the CorCap cardiac support device as an adjunct to mitral valve surgery.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>From the original Acorn trial (n = 300 patients), 193 patients were enrolled in the mitral valve repair/replacement stratum. A total of 102 were randomized to mitral valve surgery alone (control group) and 91 were randomized to mitral valve surgery with implantation of the CorCap cardiac support device (treatment group). Patients were followed up for 5 years.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>As previously reported, 30-day operative mortality was only 1.6%. At 5 years, the total mortality was 30% with an average annual mortality rate of approximately 6% per year. The effects of mitral valve surgery led to a progressive decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, which were highly significant at all time points. At the end of 5 years, there was an average reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic volume of 75 mL, which represents a 28% reduction from baseline. During 5 years of follow-up, 29 patients had recurrent mitral regurgitation and 5 patients underwent repeat mitral valve surgery. The addition of the CorCap device led to greater decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic volume (average difference of 16.5 mL; P = .05), indicating that the CorCap device had an additive effect to the mitral valve operation.</fragment>

			<section label="OBJECTIVES" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>The purpose of this study was to assess whether management of heart failure (HF) guided by an individualized N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) target would lead to improved outcome compared with HF management guided by clinical assessment alone.</fragment>

				<fragment>Natriuretic peptides may be attractive biomarkers to guide management of heart failure (HF) and help select patients in need of more aggressive therapy. The PRIMA (Can PRo-brain-natriuretic peptide guided therapy of chronic heart failure IMprove heart fAilure morbidity and mortality?) study is, to our knowledge, the first large, prospective randomized study to address whether management of HF guided by an individualized target NT-proBNP level improves outcome.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A total of 345 patients hospitalized for decompensated, symptomatic HF with elevated NT-proBNP levels at admission were included. After discharge, patients were randomized to either clinically-guided outpatient management (n = 171), or management guided by an individually set NT-proBNP (n = 174) defined by the lowest level at discharge or 2 weeks thereafter. The primary end point was defined as number of days alive outside the hospital after index admission.</fragment>

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>HF management guided by this individualized NT-proBNP target increased the use of HF medication (p = 0.006), and 64% of HF-related events were preceded by an increase in NT-proBNP.

				<fragment>Patients receiving hemodialysis have high rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality that may be related to the hemodynamic effects of rapid ultrafiltration. Here we tested whether higher dialytic ultrafiltration rates are associated with greater all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalization for cardiovascular disease. We used data from the Hemodialysis Study, an almost-7-year randomized clinical trial of 1846 patients receiving thrice-weekly chronic dialysis. The ultrafiltration rates were divided into three categories: up to 10 ml/h/kg, 10-13 ml/h/kg, and over 13 ml/h/kg. Compared to ultrafiltration rates in the lowest group, rates in the highest were significantly associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality with adjusted hazard ratios of 1.59 and 1.71, respectively. Overall, ultrafiltration rates between 10-13 ml/h/kg were not associated with all-cause or cardiovascular mortality; however, they were significantly associated among participants with congestive heart failure. Cubic spline interpolation suggested that the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality began to increase at ultrafiltration rates over 10 ml/h/kg regardless of the status of congestive heart failure. Hence, higher ultrafiltration rates in hemodialysis patients are associated with a greater risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>Previous studies suggest that adenosine A₁ receptor antagonists may promote natriuresis without deleterious effects on renal function. This study evaluated renal and hemodynamic effects as well as safety, pharmacokinetics, and tolerability of BG9928, a selective adenosine A₁-receptor antagonist, in patients with heart failure. In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study, 33 patients received a single dose of BG9928 (0.03, 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg) or placebo intravenously. Change from baseline in urinary sodium excretion for the 8-hour postdose interval was greater for all dosing groups versus placebo. The 0.03-mg/kg and 0.3-mg/kg groups had significant reductions in body weight versus placebo (-0.8 kg, -1.1 kg, 0.3 kg, respectively; P &lt; 005). No changes in creatinine clearance or hemodynamic parameters were observed among any of the BG9928 groups versus placebo. However, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure tended to decrease and correlated with weight loss. Across the range of doses studied, pharmacokinetic parameters were linear and predictable. One patient who received the highest dose (3.0 mg/kg) developed seizures, and no further patients received that dose. Single intravenous BG9928 doses of up to 1.0 mg/kg were well tolerated and increased sodium excretion without worsening renal function. Further studies are needed to determine the clinical benefit of adenosine A₁ receptor antagonism.</fragment>

				<fragment>Worsening renal function, which is associated with adverse outcomes, often develops in patients with acute heart failure. Experimental and clinical studies suggest that counterregulatory responses mediated by adenosine may be involved. We tested the hypothesis that the use of rolofylline, an adenosine A1-receptor antagonist, would improve dyspnea, reduce the risk of worsening renal function, and lead to a more favorable clinical course in patients with acute heart failure.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving patients hospitalized for acute heart failure with impaired renal function. Within 24 hours after presentation, 2033 patients were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive daily intravenous rolofylline (30 mg) or placebo for up to 3 days. The primary end point was treatment success, treatment failure, or no change in the patient's clinical condition; this end point was defined according to survival, heart-failure status, and changes in renal function. Secondary end points were the post-treatment development of persistent renal impairment and the 60-day rate of death or readmission for cardiovascular or renal causes.</fragment>

Persistent renal impairment developed in 15.0% of patients in the rolofylline group and in 13.7% of patients in the placebo group (P=0.44). By 60 days, death or readmission for cardiovascular or renal causes had occurred in similar proportions of patients assigned to rolofylline and placebo (30.7% and 31.9%, respectively; P=0.86).

		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Chronic heart failure is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Raised resting heart rate is a risk factor for adverse outcomes. We aimed to assess the effect of heart-rate reduction by the selective sinus-node inhibitor ivabradine on outcomes in heart failure.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Patients were eligible for participation in this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study if they had symptomatic heart failure and a left-ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or lower, were in sinus rhythm with heart rate 70 beats per min or higher, had been admitted to hospital for heart failure within the previous year, and were on stable background treatment including a β blocker if tolerated. Patients were randomly assigned by computer-generated allocation schedule to ivabradine titrated to a maximum of 7.5 mg twice daily or matching placebo. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death or hospital admission for worsening heart failure. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN70429960.</fragment>

			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>6558 patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups (3268 ivabradine, 3290 placebo).

		<summary>Our analysis confirms that high heart rate is a risk factor in heart failure. Selective lowering of heart rates with ivabradine improves cardiovascular outcomes. Heart rate is an important target for treatment of heart failure.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Raised resting heart rate is a marker of cardiovascular risk. We postulated that heart rate is also a risk factor for cardiovascular events in heart failure. In the SHIFT trial, patients with chronic heart failure were treated with the selective heart-rate-lowering agent ivabradine. We aimed to test our hypothesis by investigating the association between heart rate and events in this patient population.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We analysed cardiovascular outcomes in the placebo (n=3264) and ivabradine groups (n=3241) of this randomised trial, divided by quintiles of baseline heart rate in the placebo group. The primary composite endpoint was cardiovascular death or hospital admission for worsening heart failure. In the ivabradine group, heart rate achieved at 28 days was also analysed in relation to subsequent outcomes. Analysis adjusted to change in heart rate was used to study heart-rate reduction as mechanism for risk reduction by ivabradine directly.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>In the placebo group, patients with the highest heart rates (&gt;or=87 beats per min [bpm], n=682, 286 events) were at more than two-fold higher risk for the primary composite endpoint than were patients with the lowest heart rates (70 to &lt;72 bpm, n=461, 92 events; hazard ratio [HR] 2.34, 95% CI 1.84-2.98, p&lt;0.0001). Risk of primary composite endpoint events increased by 3% with every beat increase from baseline heart rate and 16% for every 5-bpm increase. In the ivabradine group, there was a direct association between heart rate achieved at 28 days and subsequent cardiac outcomes. Patients with heart rates lower than 60 bpm at 28 days on treatment had fewer primary composite endpoint events during the study (n=1192; event rate 17.4%, 95% CI 15.3-19.6) than did patients with higher heart rates. The effect of ivabradine is accounted for by heart-rate reduction, as shown by the neutralisation of the treatment effect after adjustment for change of heart rate at 28 days (HR 0.95, 0.85-1.06, p=0.352).</fragment>

Baseline characteristics responsible for risk differences of patients enrolled in the 2 country groupings were sufficiently similar to exert little influence on clinical decision making.</fragment>

				<fragment>As the prevalence of heart failure (HF) rises sharply, the costs related to the care of these patients increases in parallel. Considering the already limited resources and manpower, in the future the demand for care may exceed the supply. Therefore, health care systems are encouraged to develop innovative strategies to deal with the burden of HF to improve the quality of care in order to medical outcomes and patients' quality of life. For that reason new management systems - such as telemonitoring - have to be explored.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Neuregulin-1 plays important roles in maintaining cardiomyocyte structure and cardiac pumping functionality and physiology. Previously, rhNRG-1 was proven to be effective in treating heart failure in animals by reducing end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV) and increasing left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF%).</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A total of 44 CHF patients designated as New York Heart Association functional class II or III were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized manner and treated with a placebo or rhNRG-1 (0.3, 0.6, or 1.2 microg/kg/day) for 10 days, in addition to standard therapies. The follow-up period was 90 days; left ventricular function and structure measured by magnetic resonance imaging were the primary end points.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Although not statistically different from placebo, the LVEF% was significantly increased by 27.11 +/- 31.12% (p = 0.009) at day 30 after rhNRG-1 treatment in the 0.6-microg/kg group, whereas it was only increased 5.83 +/- 25.75% in the placebo group (p = 0.49). In addition, there were decreases in ESV (-11.58 +/- 12.74%, p = 0.002) and EDV (-5.64 +/- 10.03%, p = 0.05) in the 0.6-microg/kg/day group at day 30; more importantly, both ESV and EDV levels continued to decrease at day 90 (-20.79 +/- 17.03% and -14.03 +/- 13.17%, respectively), accompanied by a sustained increase in LVEF%. This suggests that short-term treatment with rhNRG-1 results in a long-term reversal of remodeling. The effective dose was proven to be tolerable and safe for CHF patients.</fragment>

		<summary>Relaxation techniques are beneficial to the emotional and social health-related quality of life of Chinese patients with chronic heart failure. Combining this intervention with other treatment modalities may produce a more substantial improvement in their health-related quality of life.</summary>

			<section label="AIM" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>This paper is a report of a study conducted to examine the effects of a relaxation training programme on the health-related quality of life of Chinese patients with chronic heart failure.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Despite the substantial evidence indicating the beneficial effects of relaxation therapy on the health-related quality of life of various cardiac populations, the value of this intervention in patients with chronic heart failure remains uncertain. Even less is known about its therapeutic effects in Chinese culture.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHOD" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A total of 121 Chinese patients with chronic heart failure and over 60 years of age were recruited in 2002-2003 and randomly allocated to a relaxation training programme (n = 59) or an attention-control intervention (n = 62). The training included two relaxation training sessions, one skill revision workshop, twice daily relaxation self-practice and biweekly telephone follow-up. The World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire was completed at hospital discharge and at the 8th and 14th weeks after discharge.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Repeated measures analysis of covariance indicated that those who attended the relaxation training programme reported statistically significantly greater improvement in psychological (P = 0.007, eta(2) = 0.043) and social (P = 0.016, eta(2) = 0.035) health-related quality of life than those who received the attention-control intervention over the evaluative period. Comparing outcomes at timepoints showed that the statistically significant group differences in the improvement of psychological and social health-related quality of life occurred mainly during the first evaluative endpoints.</fragment>

Dutasteride therapy, as compared with placebo, resulted in a reduction in the rate of acute urinary retention (1.6% vs. 6.7%, a 77.3% relative reduction). The incidence of adverse events was similar to that in studies of dutasteride therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia, except that in our study, as compared with previous studies, the relative incidence of the composite category of cardiac failure was higher in the dutasteride group than in the placebo group (0.7% [30 men] vs. 0.4% [16 men], P=0.03).</fragment>

		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Noncompliance with pharmacological and nonpharmacological recommendations is a problem in many heart failure (HF) patients, leading to worse symptoms and readmission. Although knowledge is available regarding factors related to compliance with HF regimens, little is known about patients' perspectives. We investigated patients' reasons and motivations for compliance with HF regimens from their perspective, and we studied how patients manage these recommendations in daily life. The health belief model was used as a framework for this study.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A qualitative descriptive study was used, and 15 HF patients were interviewed about reasons for compliance, barriers to compliance, interventions that helped them comply with medications, sodium restriction, fluid restriction, and daily weighing.</fragment>

				<fragment>The most commonly reported reasons for compliance included fear of hospitalization and HF symptoms. Barriers to compliance were mainly related to the negative aspects of a regimen, e.g., taste of the food and thirst. Most patients tried to make their lifestyle changes part of the daily routine.

			<section>
				<fragment>In the short term, the endothelin antagonist avosentan reduces proteinuria, but whether this translates to protection from progressive loss of renal function is unknown. We examined the effects of avosentan on progression of overt diabetic nephropathy in a multicenter, multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We randomly assigned 1392 participants with type 2 diabetes to oral avosentan (25 or 50 mg) or placebo in addition to continued angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and/or angiotensin receptor blockade. The composite primary outcome was the time to doubling of serum creatinine, ESRD, or death. Secondary outcomes included changes in albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and cardiovascular outcomes. We terminated the trial prematurely after a median follow-up of 4 months (maximum 16 months) because of an excess of cardiovascular events with avosentan. We did not detect a difference in the frequency of the primary outcome between groups. Avosentan significantly reduced ACR: In patients who were treated with avosentan 25 mg/d, 50 mg/d, and placebo, the median reduction in ACR was 44.3, 49.3, and 9.7%, respectively. Adverse events led to discontinuation of trial medication significantly more often for avosentan than for placebo (19.6 and 18.2 versus 11.5% for placebo), dominated by fluid overload and congestive heart failure; death occurred in 21 (4.6%; P = 0.225), 17 (3.6%; P = 0.194), and 12 (2.6%), respectively. In conclusion, avosentan reduces albuminuria when added to standard treatment in people with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy but induces significant fluid overload and congestive heart failure.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>Context: Widespread thyroid hormone actions offer the possibility of developing selective thyromimetic analogs with salutary metabolic properties. Consequently, effects of diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) on body weight, serum lipoproteins, and bone metabolism markers were studied in a prospective, controlled, double-blind 24-wk trial, which was primarily designed to assess treatment of stable chronic heart failure. Design: Eighty-six patients (aged 66 +/- 11 yr, mean +/- sd) were randomized (1:2) to placebo or an escalating DITPA dose (90 to 180, 270, and 360 mg/d) over 8 wk until serum TSH was less than 0.02 mU/liter. Patients were studied at 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, and 24 wk and after 4 wk off study drug. Only 21 DITPA-treated and 27 placebo patients completed the full 24 wk of therapy. Results: DITPA therapy lowered serum TSH levels and, to a lesser extent, serum T(3) and T(4), but there were no differences in clinical manifestations of thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism. Serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels both decreased on DITPA; there was a transient decrease in triglycerides and no change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. DITPA therapy was associated with significant reduction in body weight, 12.5 lb at 24 wk. Increases in serum osteocalcin, N-telopeptide, and deoxypyridinoline levels were consistent with increased bone turnover on DITPA. Conclusion: This investigation of DITPA actions demonstrated its efficacy in reducing body weight and lowering total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. However, DITPA's adverse effects at doses used resulted in a high dropout rate and potentially dangerous skeletal actions were observed.</fragment>

				<fragment>This double-blind trial was undertaken in 255 sites in 30 countries. 3846 patients with heart failure of New York Heart Association class II-IV, left-ventricular ejection fraction 40% or less, and intolerance to angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were randomly assigned to losartan 150 mg (n=1927) or 50 mg daily (n=1919). Allocation was by block randomisation stratified by centre and presence or absence of beta-blocker therapy, and all patients and investigators were masked to assignment. The primary endpoint was death or admission for heart failure. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00090259.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Six patients in each group were excluded because of poor data quality. With 4.7-year median follow-up in each group (IQR 3.7-5.5 for losartan 150 mg; 3.4-5.5 for losartan 50 mg), 828 (43%) patients in the 150 mg group versus 889 (46%) in the 50 mg group died or were admitted for heart failure (hazard ratio [HR] 0.90, 95% CI 0.82-0.99; p=0.027). For the two primary endpoint components, 635 patients in the 150 mg group versus 665 in the 50 mg group died (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84-1.04; p=0.24), and 450 versus 503 patients were admitted for heart failure (0.87, 0.76-0.98; p=0.025). Renal impairment (n=454 vs 317), hypotension (203 vs 145), and hyperkalaemia (195 vs 131) were more common in the 150 mg group than in the 50 mg group, but these adverse events did not lead to significantly more treatment discontinuations in the 150 mg group.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="INTERPRETATION" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>Losartan 150 mg daily reduced the rate of death or admission for heart failure in patients with heart failure, reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction, and intolerance to ACE inhibitors compared with losartan 50 mg daily. These findings show the value of up-titrating ARB doses to confer clinical benefit.</fragment>

				<fragment>We investigated whether plasma amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), a marker of cardiac dysfunction and prognosis measured in CORONA (Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Trial in Heart Failure), could be used to identify the severity of heart failure at which statins become ineffective.</fragment>

				<fragment>Of 5,011 patients enrolled, NT-proBNP was measured in 3,664 (73%). The midtertile included values between 103 pmol/l (868 pg/ml) and 277 pmol/l (2,348 pg/ml). Log NT-proBNP was the strongest predictor (per log unit) of every outcome assessed but was strongest for death from worsening heart failure (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.99; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.71 to 2.30), was weaker for sudden death (HR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.52 to 1.88), and was weakest for atherothrombotic events (HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.40).

			<section>
				<fragment>The CHOIR trial in anemic patients with chronic kidney disease compared epoetin-alfa treatment with low (11.3 g/l) and high (13.5 g/l) hemoglobin targets on the composite end point of death, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke, and myocardial infarction. However, other anemia management trials in patients with chronic kidney disease found there was increased risk when hemoglobin is targeted above 13 g/dl. In this secondary analysis of the CHOIR trial, we compared outcomes among the subgroups of patients with diabetes and heart failure to describe the comparative relationship of treatment to these two different hemoglobin goals. By Cox regression analysis, there was no increased risk associated with the higher hemoglobin target among patients with heart failure. In patients without heart failure, however, the hazard ratio (1.86) associated with the higher target was significant. Comparing survival curves in an unadjusted model, patients with diabetes did not have a greater hazard associated with the higher target. Subjects without diabetes had a significantly greater hazard in the high as compared to the low target, but the interaction between diabetes and the target was not significant. We suggest that the increased risks associated with higher hemoglobin targets are not clinically apparent among subgroups with greater mortality risk. These differential outcomes underscore the need for dedicated trials in these subpopulations.</fragment>

		<summary>CRT combined with ICD decreased the risk of heart-failure events in relatively asymptomatic patients with a low ejection fraction and wide QRS complex. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00180271.)</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>This trial was designed to determine whether cardiac-resynchronization therapy (CRT) with biventricular pacing would reduce the risk of death or heart-failure events in patients with mild cardiac symptoms, a reduced ejection fraction, and a wide QRS complex.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>During a 4.5-year period, we enrolled and followed 1820 patients with ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy, an ejection fraction of 30% or less, a QRS duration of 130 msec or more, and New York Heart Association class I or II symptoms. Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to receive CRT plus an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) (1089 patients) or an ICD alone (731 patients). The primary end point was death from any cause or a nonfatal heart-failure event (whichever came first). Heart-failure events were diagnosed by physicians who were aware of the treatment assignments, but they were adjudicated by a committee that was unaware of assignments.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>During an average follow-up of 2.4 years, the primary end point occurred in 187 of 1089 patients in the CRT-ICD group (17.2%) and 185 of 731 patients in the ICD-only group (25.3%) (hazard ratio in the CRT-ICD group, 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 0.84; P=0.001). The benefit did not differ significantly between patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and those with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. The superiority of CRT was driven by a 41% reduction in the risk of heart-failure events, a finding that was evident primarily in a prespecified subgroup of patients with a QRS duration of 150 msec or more. CRT was associated with a significant reduction in left ventricular volumes and improvement in the ejection fraction. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the overall risk of death, with a 3% annual mortality rate in each treatment group. Serious adverse events were infrequent in the two groups.</fragment>

		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Aldosterone has a key role in the pathophysiology of heart failure. In around 50% of such patients, aldosterone "escapes" from inhibition by drugs that interrupt the renin-angiotensin axis; such patients have a worse clinical outcome. Insulin resistance is a risk factor in heart failure and cardiovascular disease. The relation between aldosterone status and insulin sensitivity was investigated in a cohort of heart failure patients.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>302 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV heart failure on conventional therapy were randomised in the ALiskiren Observation of heart Failure Treatment study (ALOFT), designed to test the safety of a directly acting renin inhibitor. Plasma aldosterone and 24-hour urinary aldosterone excretion, as well as fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were measured. Subjects with aldosterone escape and high urinary aldosterone were identified according to previously accepted definitions.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>20% of subjects demonstrated aldosterone escape and 34% had high urinary aldosterone levels.

Aldosterone escape and high urinary aldosterone subjects both demonstrated higher levels of fasting insulin (p&lt;0.008, p&lt;0.03), HOMA-IR (p&lt;0.06, p&lt;0.03) and insulin-glucose ratios (p&lt;0.006, p&lt;0.06) when compared to low aldosterone counterparts.

		<summary/>
		<content>
			<section>
				<fragment>We have recently reported a validation study of a prototype low-field strength quantitative magnetic resonance (QMR) instrument for measurement of human body composition (EchoMRI-AH). QMR was very precise, but underreported fat mass (FM) by 2-4 kg when compared to a 4-compartment (4C) model in this cross-sectional study. Here, we report the performance of an updated instrument in two longitudinal studies where FM was decreasing. Healthy obese volunteers were given a modest energy deficit diet for 8 weeks (study A) and obese patients with heart failure and/or at high cardiovascular risk were prescribed a low energy liquid diet for 6 weeks (study B). FM was measured at the start and end of these periods by QMR, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and 4C. A higher proportion of the weight lost came from fat in study A compared with study B, where loss of total body water (TBW) played a greater part. The intraclass correlation between QMR and 4C estimates of FM loss (DeltaFat) was 0.95, but 20 of 22 estimates of DeltaFat by QMR were lower than the corresponding estimate by the 4C model. Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated that estimates of FM loss by QMR were ~1.0 and 0.7 kg lower than those obtained with 4C (P = 0.0008) and DXA (P = 0.049), respectively. Measurement precision remained high. QMR measurement should prove valuable for quantifying modest changes of FM in small trials.</fragment>

Glucose and potassium concentrations were measured twice serially at baseline, every 10 minutes during infusion, every 15 minutes for the first hour after infusion, and every 30 minutes for the second hour after infusion. The median area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was calculated for changes in glucose and potassium concentrations. As assessed by glucose AUC, there was no significant difference in the degree of beta(2)-blockade between metoprolol 200 mg and carvedilol 25 mg. In contrast to these data, the degree of beta(2)-blockade as assessed by potassium AUC was greater for carvedilol compared with metoprolol across all doses.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>BNP level is a prognostic marker for all-cause mortality (ACM) in ADHF; whether early BNP changes can also help predict outcome in patients who need inotropes for treatment of severe ADHF is not known.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We retrospectively assessed the association between changes in BNP levels and ACM in patients from the SURVIVE (Survival of Patients with Acute Heart Failure in Need of Intravenous Inotropic Support) trial--a randomized, controlled trial comparing levosimendan to dobutamine treatment in patients hospitalized with ADHF. BNP levels were measured at baseline and at days 1, 3, and 5. A patient was classified as a "responder" if the follow-up BNP level was &gt;or=30% lower than baseline BNP. The relationship between early BNP response and subsequent ACM over short- (31-day) and long-term (180-day) intervals was evaluated.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Of 1,327 SURVIVE patients, this analysis included 1,038 who had BNP samples at both baseline and day 5. Responders at days 1, 3, and 5 had lower ACM than did nonresponders (p &lt;or= 0.001), with day-5 levels showing superior discriminating value. Short-term ACM (31-day) risk reduction was 67% in day-5 BNP responders compared with nonresponders, whereas long-term (180-day) ACM risk reduction was 47%.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="CONCLUSIONS" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>Patients with lowered BNP on treatment for ADHF had reduced mortality risks (31- and 180-day) compared to those with little or no BNP decrease. These results suggest that early lowering of BNP predicts both short- and long-term mortality risks. BNP reduction may therefore serve as a suitable prognostic marker of ACM.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) is reevaluated considering information from new clinical trials, meta-analyses, and recent subgroup and explanatory analyses from ALLHAT, especially those regarding heart failure (HF) and the association of drug treatment with new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM) and its cardiovascular disease (CVD) consequences. Chlorthalidone was superior to (1) doxazosin mesylate in preventing combined CVD (CCVD) (risk ratio [RR], 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.27), especially HF (RR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.40-2.22) and stroke (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.10-1.46); (2) lisinopril in preventing CCVD (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16), including stroke (in black persons only) and HF (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.09-1.34); and (3) amlodipine besylate in preventing HF, overall (by 28%) and in hospitalized or fatal cases (by 26%). Central independent blinded reassessment of HF hospitalizations confirmed each comparison. Results were consistent by age, sex, race (except for stroke and CCVD), DM status, metabolic syndrome status, and renal function level. Neither amlodipine nor lisinopril was superior to chlorthalidone in preventing end-stage renal disease overall, by DM status, or by renal function level. In the chlorthalidone arm, new-onset DM was not significantly associated with CCVD (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.88-2.42). Evidence from subsequent analyses of ALLHAT and other clinical outcome trials confirm that neither alpha-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, nor calcium channel blockers surpass thiazide-type diuretics (at appropriate dosage) as initial therapy for reduction of cardiovascular or renal risk. Thiazides are superior in preventing HF, and new-onset DM associated with thiazides does not increase CVD outcomes.</fragment>

				<fragment>Surgical ventricular reconstruction is a specific procedure designed to reduce left ventricular volume in patients with heart failure caused by coronary artery disease.

			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Between September 2002 and January 2006, a total of 1000 patients with an ejection fraction of 35% or less, coronary artery disease that was amenable to CABG, and dominant anterior left ventricular dysfunction that was amenable to surgical ventricular reconstruction were randomly assigned to undergo either CABG alone (499 patients) or CABG with surgical ventricular reconstruction (501 patients).

		<summary>When given to patients with acute heart failure and normal-to-increased blood pressure, relaxin was associated with favourable relief of dyspnoea and other clinical outcomes, with acceptable safety.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Most patients admitted for acute heart failure have normal or increase blood pressure. Relaxin is a natural human peptide that affects multiple vascular control pathways, suggesting potential mechanisms of benefit for such patients. We assessed the dose response of relaxin's effect on symptom relief, other clinical outcomes, and safety.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In a placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging study, 234 patients with acute heart failure, dyspnoea, congestion on chest radiograph, and increased brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal prohormone of BNP, mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency, and systolic blood pressure greater than 125 mm Hg were recruited from 54 sites in eight countries and enrolled within 16 h of presentation. Patients were randomly assigned, in a double-blind manner via a telephone-based interactive voice response system, to standard care plus 48-h intravenous infusion of placebo (n=62) or relaxin 10 microg/kg (n=40), 30 microg/kg (n=43), 100 microg/kg (n=39), or 250 microg/kg (n=50) per day. Several clinical endpoints were explored to assess whether intravenous relaxin should be pursued in larger studies of acute heart failure, to identify an optimum dose, and to help to assess endpoint selection and power calculations. Analysis was by modified intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00520806.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>In the modified intention-to-treat population, 61 patients were assessed in the placebo group, 40 in the relaxin 10 microg/kg per day group, 42 in the relaxin 30 microg/kg per day group, 37 in the relaxin 100 microg/kg per day group, and 49 in the relaxin 250 microg/kg per day group. Dyspnoea improved with relaxin 30 microg/kg compared with placebo, as assessed by Likert scale (17 of 42 patients [40%] moderately or markedly improved at 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h vs 14 of 61 [23%]; p=0.044) and visual analogue scale through day 14 (8214 mm x h [SD 8712] vs 4622 mm x h [9003]; p=0.053). Length of stay was 10.2 days (SD 6.1) for relaxin-treated patients versus 12.0 days (7.3) for those given placebo, and days alive out of hospital were 47.9 (10.1) versus 44.2 (14.2). Cardiovascular death or readmission due to heart or renal failure at day 60 was reduced with relaxin (2.6% [95% CI 0.4-16.8] vs 17.2% [9.6-29.6]; p=0.053). The number of serious adverse events was similar between groups.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) often coexist. The aim was to investigate whether restoring sinus rhythm (SR) could improve cardiac function, symptoms, exercise capacity and quality of life (QoL) in patients with chronic heart failure.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Patients with HF and persistent AF receiving guideline-recommended treatments, including anticoagulants, were eligible for the study. Patients were randomised to either rhythm (treated with amiodarone for at least 3 months prior to attempting biphasic external cardioversion and continued amiodarone long-term if SR was restored) or rate control. Anticoagulants were continued throughout the study regardless of rhythm, unless contraindications developed. Both groups were treated with beta blockers and/or digoxin to reduce the heart rate to &lt;80 bpm at rest and &lt;110 bpm after walking. Symptoms, walk distance (6-minute corridor walk test, 6MWT), QoL and cardiac function were assessed at baseline and 1 year.</fragment>

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>61 patients with HF and persistent AF (median duration 14 months (IQR 5 to 32)) were randomly assigned to a rate or rhythm control strategy. Of patients assigned to rhythm control (n = 30), 66% were in SR at 1 year, and 90% of those assigned to rate control (n = 31) achieved the heart rate target. At 1 year, NYHA class (p = 0.424) and 6MWT distance (p = 0.342) were similar between groups but patients assigned to rhythm control had improved LV function (p = 0.014), NT-proBNP concentration (p = 0.046) and QoL (p = 0.019) compared with those assigned to rate control.

			<section>
				<fragment>Patients given implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) after arrhythmic events or sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) experience psychosocial distress. ICDs now are inserted for the primary prevention of SCA in patients with heart failure; the psychosocial impact of ICDs on patients with heart failure is unknown. Changes in psychosocial status in these ICD recipients were examined. ICD recipients (n = 57) completed depression, anxiety, and social support inventories every 6 months for up to 2 years. Initially, 35% of recipients were depressed and 45% of recipients were anxious. In linear mixed models, depression decreased over time overall but increased in those who experienced ICD shocks. Anxiety decreased in New York Heart Association class III ICD recipients but not in class II ICD recipients. Decreases in social support were related to age: the younger the patient the greater the decrease. A significant proportion of ICD recipients were depressed or anxious, or had diminished social support even after 2 years. Investigation of strategies to improve ICD recipients' psychosocial status is warranted.</fragment>

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Of the 670 CHF patients completing the questionnaire, 17% reported at least one AE. In total, 186 AEs were reported of which 15% could not be linked to any medication. Nausea (4%), dizziness (4%), itches (3%) and rash (3%) were the most prevalent. The drug associated with the highest AE rate was pravastatin (27%). On average, more than five different drugs could be related to the AEs headache, dizziness and nausea. Patients reporting AEs had a lower general health perception, younger age and were more often using antiarrhythmic drugs.

			<section label="OBJECTIVES" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>This study sought to evaluate the association between changes over time of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) expressed in different ways and outcome in patients with stable and chronic heart failure (HF).</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Although previous studies examined the prognostic value of repeated determinations of BNP in HF, there are only limited data on the clinical utility of serial measurements of the inactive peptide NT-proBNP in a large population of ambulatory patients with chronic HF with sufficient follow-up time.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>The NT-proBNP was measured at randomization and after 4 months in 1,742 patients enrolled in the placebo arm of Val-HeFT (Valsartan Heart Failure Trial). Changes in NT-proBNP concentrations over 4 months were expressed as absolute change from baseline, percent relative changes, or categorical changes across a threshold value and related to subsequent mortality.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>A single determination of NT-proBNP (area under the curve at 4 months: 0.702, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.669 to 0.735) showed a higher prognostic discrimination than continuous changes of concentrations, expressed either as absolute (0.592, 95% CI: 0.549 to 0.634) or relative changes (0.602, 95% CI: 0.566 to 0.639). A Cox proportional hazards model showed that stratification of patients into 4 categories according to NT-proBNP levels at 2 time points 4 months apart with respect to a threshold concentration provided prognostic information in patients with chronic HF beyond that of a single determination.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Several epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) can exert favourable effects on atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease, including arrhythmias. We investigated whether n-3 PUFA could improve morbidity and mortality in a large population of patients with symptomatic heart failure of any cause.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We undertook a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 326 cardiology and 31 internal medicine centres in Italy. We enrolled patients with chronic heart failure of New York Heart Association class II-IV, irrespective of cause and left ventricular ejection fraction, and randomly assigned them to n-3 PUFA 1 g daily (n=3494) or placebo (n=3481) by a concealed, computerised telephone randomisation system. Patients were followed up for a median of 3.9 years (IQR 3.0-4.5). Primary endpoints were time to death, and time to death or admission to hospital for cardiovascular reasons. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00336336.</fragment>

		<summary>The use of a nurse-led disease management programme is associated with increased costs in other coronary heart disease-related services as well as for the costs of the clinics.

			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>To determine if a disease management programme for patients with coronary heart disease and heart failure represents an efficient use of health services resources.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We carried out an economic evaluation alongside a cluster randomised control trial of 1163 patients with coronary heart disease and chronic heart failure in 20 primary care practices in the United Kingdom. Practices were randomised to either a control group, where patients received standard general practice care, or an intervention group where patients had access to a specialist nurse-led disease management programme. We estimated costs in both groups for coronary heart disease-related resource use. The main outcome measure used in the economic evaluation was quality adjusted life years (QALY) measured using the EuroQol.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>The disease management programme was associated with an increase in the QALY measured of 0.03 per year and an increase in the total NHS costs of 425 pounds (540 euros), of this only 83 pounds was directly associated with the provision of the nurse clinics.
