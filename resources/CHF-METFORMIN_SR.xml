		<summary>In patients at high CV risk without HF, ACE-Is and ARBs reduced the risk of the composite outcome of CV death, MI, and stroke. ACE-Is also reduced the risk of all-cause death, new-onset HF, and new-onset DM. Thus, ARBs represent a valuable option to reduce CV mortality and morbidity in patients in whom ACE-Is cannot be used.</summary>

			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>We sought to conduct a systematic review to evaluate the effects of interventions on depression in adults with heart failure (HF).</fragment>

			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Published, peer-reviewed, English-language, prospective interventional studies were identified in a search of Medline, CINAHL, PsychINFO, and the Cochrane Libraries of Systematic Reviews and Clinical Trials from 1996 through August 2011 and relevant bibliographies. Eligible studies included patients with New York Heart Association functional class II and III HF with experimental or quasiexperimental designs and preintervention and postintervention measures of depression. Ineligible studies were nonpharmacologic with a sample size &lt;50, and drug studies without a comparison group.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Twenty-three experimental and quasiexperimental studies that enrolled a total of 3564 persons with HF contributed evidence about 6 types of interventions: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, exercise, disease management programs, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), and a multimodal intervention of cognitive behavioral therapy and exercise. Studies with SSRIs examined effects of sertraline, paroxetine, and citalopram. The CAM interventions included tai chi, progressive muscle relaxation therapy, and mindfulness-based stress reduction.</fragment>

		<summary>The results of this meta-analysis suggest that AA is associated with significant improvements in EF and functional class independent of baseline functional capacity.

		<summary>BNP has considerable diagnostic value in addition to signs and symptoms in patients suspected of heart failure in primary care. However, using BNP alone with the currently recommended cut-off levels is not sufficient to make a reliable diagnosis of heart failure.</summary>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Diagnosing early stages of heart failure with mild symptoms is difficult. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has promising biochemical test characteristics, but its diagnostic yield on top of readily available diagnostic knowledge has not been sufficiently quantified in early stages of heart failure.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="OBJECTIVES" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>To quantify the added diagnostic value of BNP for the diagnosis of heart failure in a population relevant to GPs and validate the findings in an independent primary care patient population.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="DESIGN" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Individual patient data meta-analysis followed by external validation. The additional diagnostic yield of BNP above standard clinical information was compared with ECG and chest x-ray results.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="PATIENTS AND METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Derivation was performed on two existing datasets from Hillingdon (n=127) and Rotterdam (n=149) while the UK Natriuretic Peptide Study (n=306) served as validation dataset. Included were patients with suspected heart failure referred to a rapid-access diagnostic outpatient clinic. Case definition was according to the ESC guideline. Logistic regression was used to assess discrimination (with the c-statistic) and calibration.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Of the 276 patients in the derivation set, 30.8% had heart failure. The clinical model (encompassing age, gender, known coronary artery disease, diabetes, orthopnoea, elevated jugular venous pressure, crackles, pitting oedema and S3 gallop) had a c-statistic of 0.79. Adding, respectively, chest x-ray results, ECG results or BNP to the clinical model increased the c-statistic to 0.84, 0.85 and 0.92. Neither ECG nor chest x-ray added significantly to the 'clinical plus BNP' model. All models had adequate calibration. The 'clinical plus BNP' diagnostic model performed well in an independent cohort with comparable inclusion criteria (c-statistic=0.91 and adequate calibration). Using separate cut-off values for 'ruling in' (typically implying referral for echocardiography) and for 'ruling out' heart failure--creating a grey zone--resulted in insufficient proportions of patients with a correct diagnosis.</fragment>

				<fragment>BNP has considerable diagnostic value in addition to signs and symptoms in patients suspected of heart failure in primary care. However, using BNP alone with the currently recommended cut-off levels is not sufficient to make a reliable diagnosis of heart failure.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>The UK National Health Service (NHS) currently spends in excess of £250 million per annum on angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure; with candesartan currently dominating the market. With the recent introduction of generic losartan, we set out to directly compare the branded market leader to its now cheaper alternative. The primary objectives were to compare the blood pressure (BP) lowering efficacy and cardiovascular outcomes of candesartan and losartan in the treatment of essential hypertension and chronic heart failure, respectively. The secondary objective was to model their comparative incremental cost-effectiveness in a UK NHS setting. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library 2009, issue 2), which contains the Hypertension and Heart Group's specialist register, Medline (1950-February 2010), and Embase (1980-February 2010) were included in the search strategy. Selection criteria were randomised studies of candesartan versus losartan in adults (&gt; 18 years). The main outcome measures were as follows: Hypertension: mean change from baseline in trough (24 h postdose) systolic and diastolic BP. Heart failure: composite of cardiovascular death and hospital admission for management of heart failure. Two reviewers applied inclusion criteria, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. Eight (three of which met inclusion criteria) and zero trials compared candesartan directly with losartan in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure, respectively. A between-treatment difference of -1.96 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI) -2.40 to -1.51] for trough diastolic BP and -3.00 mmHg (95% CI -3.79 to -2.22) for trough systolic BP in favour of candesartan was observed. Based on this differential, a 10-year Markov model estimates the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained to exceed £40,000 for using candesartan in place of generic losartan. Candesartan reduces BP to a slightly greater extent when compared with losartan, however, such difference is unlikely to be cost-effective based on current acquisition costs, perceived NHS affordability thresholds and use of combination regimens. We could find no robust evidence supporting the superiority of candesartan over losartan in the treatment of heart failure. We therefore recommend using generic losartan as the ARB of choice which could save the UK NHS approximately £200 million per annum in drug costs.</fragment>

		<summary>Exchangeability between trials was poor and there was a lack of robust data in RCTs.Only two good-quality trials of aldosterone inhibitors in the postMI HF population were found, but lack of exchangeability with respect to study populations, meant that a comparison between these drugs could not be done. It consistently emerged that, compared with usual care, use of an aldosterone antagonist appears to be a highly cost-effective strategy for the management of postMI HF patients in the NHS. An adequately powered, well-conducted RCT that directly compares spironolactone and eplerenone is required to provide more robust evidence on the optimal management of postMI HF patients.</summary>

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of spironolactone, eplerenone, canrenone or potassium canrenoate were included if conducted in a postMI HF population. Trials of general HF patients with a subgroup of postMI HF patients were considered if they had at least 100 ischaemic participants per arm and the authors provided subgroup data when contacted. Adverse events summary data were sought from recognised reference sources and RCTs or observational studies in any population that recruited more than 100 participants.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="REVIEW METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>The comparative clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of spironolactone and eplerenone was derived using Bayesian meta-regression drawing on a wider 'network' of aldosterone trials to those considered in the main clinical effectiveness review. An alternative scenario was also considered assuming a 'class effect' for the aldosterone antagonists in terms of major clinical events, but allowing for potential differences in side effect profiles. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) where appropriate. Uncertainty in cost-effectiveness results was also presented and used to inform future research priorities using VOI analyses based on expected value of perfect information (EVPI). A probabilistic decision analytic model was developed to estimate cost-effectiveness of spironolactone, eplerenone and standard care for management of postMI HF, provide estimates relevant to the NHS and explore alternative approaches to an indirect comparison between spironolactone and eplerenone. The model incorporated a lifetime horizon to estimate outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs from the NHS persepctive. In the base-case analysis, 2-year treatment duration was assumed, consistent with the follow-up in the main RCTs. Other scenarios were explored to examine the robustness of alternative assumptions including impact of different treatment durations.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Searches yielded five RCTs: two spironolactone trials of poor methodological quality and three trials of which only one (of eplerenone) specifically examined postMI HF (Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study, EPHESUS). One trial of spironolactone (Randomised Aldactone Evaluation Study, RALES) and one of canrenone (Antiremodelling Effect of Aldosterone receptors blockade with canrenone In mild Chronic Heart Failure, AREA IN-CHF) comprised general HF, but data were available for an ischaemic subgroup. Structural similarity of spironolactone and eplerenone suggests that they may be interchangeable, but formal indirect comparison between the three trials was severely limited by trial differences. Relative safety data were limited from RCTs and observational sources. Hyperkalaemia rates varied, but were generally higher than for placebo; data were insufficient to assess discontinuation because of hyperkalaemia.Gynaecomastia rates were higher with spironolactone. Adverse event data were sparse. Systematic review of economic evidence identified three main published studies but none used a UK perspective or attempted to compare cost-effectiveness in postMI HF. The new decision model indicated that eplerenone was the most cost-effective strategy for postMI HF (ICER of eplerenone compared with standard care was 4457 pounds per QALY, increasing to 7893 pounds per QALY if treatment continued over the patient's lifetime); in neither scenario did spironolactone appear cost-effective. The ICER of eplerenone was consistently under the 20,000-30,000 pounds per QALY threshold used to establish value for money in the NHS. Uncertainty resulted in EVPI estimates between 820M pounds (base-case) and 1265M pounds (lifetime treatment duration scenario). When class effect for mortality and hospitalisations was assumed spironolactone emerged as the most cost-effective treatment and EVPI estimates were negligible. If class effect is considered more plausible than the results of the evidence synthesis model then there would be limited value in additional research.</fragment>

			<section label="LIMITATIONS" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>Exchangeability between trials was poor and there was a lack of robust data in RCTs.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="CONCLUSIONS" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>Only two good-quality trials of aldosterone inhibitors in the postMI HF population were found, but lack of exchangeability with respect to study populations, meant that a comparison between these drugs could not be done. It consistently emerged that, compared with usual care, use of an aldosterone antagonist appears to be a highly cost-effective strategy for the management of postMI HF patients in the NHS. An adequately powered, well-conducted RCT that directly compares spironolactone and eplerenone is required to provide more robust evidence on the optimal management of postMI HF patients.</fragment>

		<summary>B-type natriuretic peptide-guided therapy reduces all-cause mortality in patients with chronic HF compared with usual clinical care, especially in patients younger than 75 years. A component of this survival benefit may be due to increased use of agents proven to decrease mortality in chronic HF.

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>The use of plasma levels of B-type natriuretic peptides (BNPs) to guide treatment of patients with chronic heart failure (HF) has been investigated in a number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

				<fragment>To assess the accuracy in diagnosing heart failure of clinical features and potential primary care investigations, and to perform a decision analysis to test the impact of plausible diagnostic strategies on costs and diagnostic yield in the UK health-care setting.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="DATA SOURCES" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched from inception to 7 July 2006. 'Grey literature' databases and conference proceedings were searched and authors of relevant studies contacted for data that could not be extracted from the published papers.</fragment>

			<section label="REVIEW METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A systematic review of the clinical evidence was carried out according to standard methods. Individual patient data (IPD) analysis was performed on nine studies, and a logistic regression model to predict heart failure was developed on one of the data sets and validated on the other data sets. Cost-effectiveness modelling was based on a decision tree that compared different plausible investigation strategies.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Dyspnoea was the only symptom or sign with high sensitivity (89%), but it had poor specificity (51%). Clinical features with relatively high specificity included history of myocardial infarction (89%), orthopnoea (89%), oedema (72%), elevated jugular venous pressure (70%), cardiomegaly (85%), added heart sounds (99%), lung crepitations (81%) and hepatomegaly (97%). However, the sensitivity of these features was low, ranging from 11% (added heart sounds) to 53% (oedema). Electrocardiography (ECG), B-type natriuretic peptides (BNP) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptides (NT-proBNP) all had high sensitivities (89%, 93% and 93% respectively). Chest X-ray was moderately specific (76-83%) but insensitive (67-68%). BNP was more accurate than ECG, with a relative diagnostic odds ratio of ECG/BNP of 0.32 (95% CI 0.12-0.87). There was no difference between the diagnostic accuracy of BNP and NT-proBNP. A model based upon simple clinical features and BNP derived from one data set was found to have good validity when applied to other data sets. A model substituting ECG for BNP was less predictive. From this a simple clinical rule was developed: in a patient presenting with symptoms such as breathlessness in whom heart failure is suspected, refer directly to echocardiography if the patient has a history of myocardial infarction or basal crepitations or is a male with ankle oedema; otherwise, carry out a BNP test and refer for echocardiography depending on the results of the test. On the basis of the cost-effectiveness analysis carried out, such a decision rule is likely to be considered cost-effective to the NHS in terms of cost per additional case detected. The cost-effectiveness analysis further suggested that, if likely benefit to the patient in terms of improved life expectancy is taken into account, the optimum strategy would be to refer all patients with symptoms suggestive of heart failure directly for echocardiography.</fragment>

				<fragment>Five studies were included in the review. In the Multicenter Study of Enhanced External Counterpulsation (MUST-EECP), time to greater than or equal to 1-mm ST segment depression (exercise-induced ischaemia) was statistically significantly improved in the EECP group compared with the control group (sham EECP), mean difference (MD) 41 seconds [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.10-73.90]. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the EECP and control groups in the change in exercise duration from baseline to end of treatment, self-reported angina episodes or daily nitroglycerin use, and the clinical significance of the limited benefits was unclear. There was also a lack of data on long-term outcomes. There were more withdrawals due to adverse events in the EECP group than in the control group, as well as a greater proportion of patients with adverse events [relative risk (RR) 2.13, 95% CI 1.35-3.38]. The three non-randomised studies compared EECP with elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and usual care. There was a high risk of selection bias in all three studies and the results should be treated with considerable caution. The study comparing an EECP registry with a PCI registry reported similar 1-year all-cause mortality in both groups. In the Prospective Evaluation of EECP in Congestive Heart Failure (PEECH) trial, patients with heart failure were randomised to EECP or to usual care (pharmacotherapy only). At 6 months post treatment, the proportion of patients achieving at least a 60-second increase in exercise duration was higher in the EECP group (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.89-2.16), but the proportion with an improvement in peak VO2 was similar in both groups. The clinical significance of this is unclear. The proportion of patients in the EECP group with an improvement in New York Heart Association classification was higher (RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.25-4.06) at 6 months, as was mean exercise duration, MD 34.6 (95% CI -4.86 to 74.06). There were more withdrawals in the EECP group than in the control group as a result of adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.67-1.66). There were limitations in the generalisability of results of the trial and, again, a lack of data on long-term outcomes. The review of cost-effectiveness evidence found only one unpublished study but demonstrated that the long-term maintenance of quality of life benefits of EECP is central to the estimate of its cost-effectiveness. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EECP was 18,643 pounds for each additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), with a probability of being cost-effective of 0.44 and 0.70 at cost-effectiveness thresholds of 20,000 pounds and 30,000 pounds per QALY gained respectively. Results were sensitive to the duration of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) benefits from treatment.</fragment>

			<section label="CONCLUSIONS" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>The results from a single randomised controlled trial (MUST-EECP) do not provide firm evidence of the clinical effectiveness of EECP in refractory stable angina or in heart failure. High-quality studies are required to investigate the benefits of EECP, whether these outweigh the common adverse effects and its long-term cost-effectiveness in terms of quality of life benefits.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>A systematic review of English-language literature was undertaken to answer the question, "Are there differences in cost or quality of inpatient medical care provided to adults by hospitalists vs nonhospitalists?" A computerized search was performed, using hospitalist and either quality, outcome, or cost as search terms. References from relevant articles were searched by hand. A standard data-extraction tool was used, and articles were included on the basis of quality and relevance. The reports that were included (N=33) show general agreement that hospitalist care leads to shorter length of stay and lower cost per stay. Three reports show improvement in outcomes for orthopedic surgery patients who had hospitalist consultation or comanagement, 3 reports show improvement in markers of quality of care for patients with pneumonia, and 2 reports show improvement in aspects of heart failure management. Further research should seek to determine why differences in care exist, whether these improvements might be generalized to other physicians, and whether hospitalists provide demonstrable benefit in other areas of care.</fragment>

		<updated>2007-11-16</updated>
		<summary>The study found that CRT-P and CRT-D devices reduce mortality and hospitalisations due to heart failure, improve quality of life and reduce SCD in people with heart failure NYHA classes III and IV, and evidence of dyssynchrony. When measured using a lifetime time horizon and compared with optimal medical therapy, the devices are estimated to be cost-effective at a WTP threshold of 30,000 British pounds per QALY; CRT-P is cost-effective at a WTP threshold of 20,000 British pounds per QALY. When the cost and effectiveness of all three treatment strategies are compared, the estimated net benefit from CRT-D is less than with the other two strategies, until the WTP threshold exceeds 40,160 British pounds/QALY. Further research is needed into the identification of those patients unlikely to benefit from this therapy, the appropriate use of CRT-D devices, the differences in mortality and heart failure hospitalisation for NYHA classes I and II, as well as the long-term implications of using this therapy.</summary>

				<fragment>Relevant data from selected studies were extracted, narrative reviews were undertaken and meta-analyses of the clinical trial data were conducted. A Markov model was developed.

			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Five randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, recruiting 3434 participants. Quality was good to moderate. Meta-analyses showed that both CRT-P and CRT-D devices significantly reduced the mortality and level of heart failure hospitalisations and they improved health-related quality of life in people with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III and IV heart failure and evidence of dyssynchrony (QRS interval &gt;120 ms) who were also receiving OPT. A single direct comparison indicated that the effects of CRT-P and CRT-D were similar, with the exception of an additional reduction in sudden cardiac death (SCD) associated with CRT-D. On average, implanting a CRT device in 13 people would result in the saving of one additional life over a 3-year period compared with OPT. The NHS device and procedure cost of implanting a new CRT-P system (pulse generator unit and required leads) was estimated to be 5074 British pounds and that of a CRT-D system 17,266 British pounds. The discounted lifetime costs of OPT, CRT-P and CRT-D were estimated as 9375 British pounds, 20,804 British pounds and 32,689 British pounds, respectively. The industry submissions to NICE contained four cost-effectiveness analyses, of which two were more appropriate as reference cases. One used a discrete event simulation model that gave estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of CRT-P vs OPT of 15,645 British pounds per QALY. The other analysis was based on the results of the COMPANION trial and estimated an ICER of 2818 British pounds per QALY gained by CRT-P vs OPT and a cost per QALY gained of 22,384 British pounds for CRT-D vs OPT. Compared with OPT, the Markov model base case analysis estimated that CRT-P conferred an additional 0.70 QALYs for an additional 11,630 British pounds per person, giving an estimated ICER of 16,735 British pounds per QALY gained for a mixed age cohort (range 14,630-20,333 British pounds). CRT-D vs CRT-P conferred an additional 0.29 QALYs for an additional 11,689 British pounds per person, giving an ICER of 40,160 British pounds per QALY for a mixed age cohort (range 26,645-59,391 British pounds). The authors' ICERs are higher than those from the industry-submitted analysis. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis based on 1000 simulated trials showed that, at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 30,000 British pounds per QALY, in CRT-P versus OPT, CRT-P was likely to be cost-effective in 91.3% of simulations and that CRT-P was negatively dominated in 0.4% of simulations. It also showed that in CRT-P versus CRT-D, CRT-D was likely to be cost-effective in 26.3% of simulations and that CRT-P dominated CRT-D in 7.8% of simulations. The relative risk for SCD when CRT-D is compared with OPT is 0.44 in the base case. This treatment becomes cost-ineffective at a WTP threshold of 30,000 British pounds when this value is greater than 0.65. When both CRT-P and CRT-D were considered as competing technologies with each other and OPT (three-way probabilistic analysis), and at the same WTP, there was a 68% probability that CRT-P provided the highest expected net benefit. The WTP threshold would need to be above 40,000 British pounds before CRT-D provided the highest expected net benefit.</fragment>

			<section label="CONCLUSIONS" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>The study found that CRT-P and CRT-D devices reduce mortality and hospitalisations due to heart failure, improve quality of life and reduce SCD in people with heart failure NYHA classes III and IV, and evidence of dyssynchrony. When measured using a lifetime time horizon and compared with optimal medical therapy, the devices are estimated to be cost-effective at a WTP threshold of 30,000 British pounds per QALY; CRT-P is cost-effective at a WTP threshold of 20,000 British pounds per QALY. When the cost and effectiveness of all three treatment strategies are compared, the estimated net benefit from CRT-D is less than with the other two strategies, until the WTP threshold exceeds 40,160 British pounds/QALY. Further research is needed into the identification of those patients unlikely to benefit from this therapy, the appropriate use of CRT-D devices, the differences in mortality and heart failure hospitalisation for NYHA classes I and II, as well as the long-term implications of using this therapy.</fragment>
