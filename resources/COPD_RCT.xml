			<section label="RATIONALE" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common lung disease leading to progressive decline in lung function. Inhibition of release of inflammatory mediators by p38 inhibitors may be a useful treatment for chronic inflammation of the airways thought to underlie the pathogenesis of the disease.</fragment>

				<fragment>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of PH-797804, a potent and selective p38 inhibitor, in adults with moderate to severe COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stage II/III).</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>This was a randomised, adaptive design, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre trial. Patients were initially randomised to placebo, 0.5, 3, 6 or 10 mg PH-797804 once daily and treated for 6 weeks following a 2-week run-in.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>The primary endpoint was change from baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) compared with placebo after 6 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints included other spirometric parameters, transition dyspnoea index, rescue mediation use, high sensitivity C-reactive protein and symptoms. A total of 230 patients were assigned to treatment; placebo (n=45), 0.5 mg (n=20), 3 mg (n=47), 6 mg (n=70) and 10 mg (n=48). PH-797804 showed a statistically significant improvement in trough FEV1 at week 6 compared with placebo of 0.086 litre (95% Bayesian CI 0.008 to 0.164) and 0.093 litre (95% CI 0.018 to 0·166) at 3 and 6 mg PH-797804, respectively. PH-797804 3 mg and 6 mg showed an improvement in the baseline dyspnoea index/transition dyspnoea index total focal score at week 6. PH-797804 was well tolerated at all doses studied.</fragment>

		<summary>The potential for muscle rehabilitation in response to RT is preserved in COPD. Except for markers of myogenesis, molecular responses to RT are not tightly coupled to lean mass gains but reflect the lower work done during RT, suggesting some caution when identifying molecular targets for intervention.

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Skeletal muscle dysfunction is a systemic feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), contributing to morbidity and mortality. Physical training improves muscle mass and function in COPD, but the molecular regulation therein is poorly understood.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Candidate genes and proteins regulating muscle protein breakdown (ubiquitin proteasome pathway), muscle protein synthesis (phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway), myogenesis (MyoD, myogenin and myostatin) and transcription (FOXO1, FOXO3 and RUNX1) were determined in quadriceps muscle samples taken at four time points over 8 weeks of knee extensor resistance training (RT) in patients with COPD and healthy controls (HCs). Patients with COPD were randomly allocated to receive protein/carbohydrate or placebo supplements during RT.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>59 patients with COPD (mean (SD) age 68.0 (9.3) years, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) 46.9 (17.8) % predicted) and 21 HCs (66.1 (4.8) years, 105.0 (21.6) % predicted) were enrolled. RT increased lean mass (~5%) and strength (~20%) in all groups. Absolute work done during RT was lower throughout in patients with COPD compared with HCs. RT resulted in increases (from basal) in catabolic, anabolic, myogenic and transcription factor protein expression at 24 h, 4 weeks and 8 weeks of exercise in HCs. This response was blunted in patients with COPD, except for myogenic signalling, which was similar. Nutritional supplementation did not augment functional or molecular responses to RT.</fragment>

Patients received 2.5 mg salbutamol mixed with either 2.5 ml isotonic magnesium sulphate (151 mg per dose) or 2.5 ml isotonic saline (placebo) on three occasions at 30 min intervals via nebuliser.

			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We enrolled 81 patients with acute exacerbations of COPD and randomly assigned them to treatment with either 40 mg oral prednisone given daily for 10 days or to 50 mg etanercept given subcutaneously at randomisation and 1 week later. Both groups received levofloxacin for 10 days plus inhaled bronchodilators. The primary endpoint was the change in the patient's forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) 14 days after randomisation. Secondary endpoints included 90-day treatment failure rates and dyspnoea and quality of life.</fragment>

				<fragment>At 14 days the mean±SE change in FEV(1) from baseline was 20.1±5.0% and 15.2±5.7% for the prednisone and etanercept groups, respectively. The mean between-treatment difference was 4.9% (95% CI -10.3% to 20.2%), p=0.52. Rates of treatment failure at 90 days were similar in the prednisone and etanercept groups (32% vs 40%, p=0.44), as were measures of dyspnoea and quality of life.

		<summary>This study will use proven case-finding methods to identify patients with undiagnosed COPD in general practice, where improved care has the potential for substantial benefit in health and healthcare utilization.

		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of disability, hospitalization, and premature mortality. General practice is well placed to diagnose and manage COPD, but there is a significant gap between evidence and current practice, with a low level of awareness and implementation of clinical practice guidelines. Under-diagnosis of COPD is a world-wide problem, limiting the benefit that could potentially be achieved through early intervention strategies such as smoking cessation, dietary advice, and exercise. General practice is moving towards more structured chronic disease management, and the increasing involvement of practice nurses in delivering chronic care.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="DESIGN" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A pragmatic cluster randomised trial will test the hypothesis that intervention by a practice nurse-general practitioner (GP) team leads to improved health-related quality of life and greater adherence with clinical practice guidelines for patients with newly-diagnosed COPD, compared with usual care. Forty general practices in greater metropolitan Sydney Australia will be recruited to identify patients at risk of COPD and invite them to attend a case finding appointment. Practices will be randomised to deliver either practice nurse-GP partnership care, or usual care, to patients newly-diagnosed with COPD.The active intervention will involve the practice nurse and GP working in partnership with the patient in developing and implementing a care plan involving (as appropriate), smoking cessation, immunisation, pulmonary rehabilitation, medication review, assessment and correction of inhaler technique, nutritional advice, management of psycho-social issues, patient education, and management of co-morbidities.The primary outcome measure is health-related quality of life, assessed with the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire 12 months after diagnosis. Secondary outcome measures include validated disease-specific and general health related quality of life measures, smoking and immunisation status, medications, inhaler technique, and lung function. Outcomes will be assessed by project officers blinded to patients' randomization groups.</fragment>

			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Sixty-eight of 111 patients from the Kansai region of Japan who were diagnosed as having COPD and were receiving standard medication participated in a randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial (July 1, 2006, through March 31, 2009) in which the patients, evaluators, and statistician were unaware of the random allocation.

				<fragment>In this controlled, randomized study we explored the effects of an uncertainty management intervention on uncertainty, anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QOL) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) outpatients in China. Ninety-six COPD outpatients completed the study (n = 49 in the intervention group; n = 47 in the control group). Over the 10-month study duration, the intervention group received a cognitive behavioral intervention. Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant improvement in uncertainty, coping strategy, anxiety, depression, and the mental health domains of QOL after the intervention, providing the first evidence that uncertainty management can improve the emotional status and QOL of COPD outpatients.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Patients with long-term conditions are increasingly the focus of quality improvement activities in health services to reduce the impact of these conditions on quality of life and to reduce the burden on care utilisation. There is significant interest in the potential for self-management support to improve health and reduce utilisation in these patient populations, but little consensus concerning the optimal model that would best provide such support. We describe the implementation and evaluation of self-management support through an evidence-based 'whole systems' model involving patient support, training for primary care teams, and service re-organisation, all integrated into routine delivery within primary care.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Randomized trials assessing the effect of systemic corticosteroids on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations excluded patients who were mechanically ventilated or admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Critically ill patients constitute a population of persons who are prone to develop complications that are potentially associated with the use of corticosteroids (eg, infections, hyperglycemia, ICU-acquired paresis) that could prolong the duration of mechanical ventilation and even increase mortality.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of systemic corticosteroid treatment in patients with an exacerbation of COPD who were receiving ventilatory support (invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation). A total of 354 adult patients who were admitted to the ICUs of 8 hospitals in 4 countries from July 2005 through July 2009 were screened, and 83 were randomized to receive intravenous methylprednisolone (0.5 mg/kg every 6 hours for 72 hours, 0.5 mg/kg every 12 hours on days 4 through 6, and 0.5 mg/kg/d on days 7 through 10) or placebo. The main outcome measures were duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, and need for intubation in patients treated with noninvasive mechanical ventilation.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>The aims were to determine the effect of an oral inhibitor of the signaling mediator p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (GW856553, losmapimod) on sputum neutrophils, pulmonary function, and blood biomarkers of inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Three hundred and two individuals with GOLD stage II COPD were randomized to oral losmapimod 7.5 mg twice daily, inhaled salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50 µg/500 µg combination (SFC), or placebo in a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study (MKI102428/NCT00642148). Neither losmapimod nor SFC had an effect on the primary end point of sputum neutrophils. Losmapimod was well tolerated and reduced plasma fibrinogen by 11% (-0.4 g/L, ratio of effect of losmapimod/placebo 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-0.96; P = .002) with nonsignificant reductions in interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and C-reactive protein. There was evidence of improvement in hyperinflation with losmapimod compared with placebo (overall P = .02). Inhaled SFC significantly improved lung function and reduced serum CC-16 (ratio of effect of SFC/placebo 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-0.93; P &lt; .001). It was concluded that oral losmapimod significantly reduced plasma fibrinogen in patients with COPD.</fragment>

		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Airway bypass is a bronchoscopic lung-volume reduction procedure for emphysema whereby transbronchial passages into the lung are created to release trapped air, supported with paclitaxel-coated stents to ease the mechanics of breathing. The aim of the EASE (Exhale airway stents for emphysema) trial was to evaluate safety and efficacy of airway bypass in people with severe homogeneous emphysema.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We undertook a randomised, double-blind, sham-controlled study in 38 specialist respiratory centres worldwide. We recruited 315 patients who had severe hyperinflation (ratio of residual volume [RV] to total lung capacity of ≥0·65). By computer using a random number generator, we randomly allocated participants (in a 2:1 ratio) to either airway bypass (n=208) or sham control (107). We divided investigators into team A (masked), who completed pre-procedure and post-procedure assessments, and team B (unmasked), who only did bronchoscopies without further interaction with patients. Participants were followed up for 12 months. The 6-month co-primary efficacy endpoint required 12% or greater improvement in forced vital capacity (FVC) and 1 point or greater decrease in the modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea score from baseline. The composite primary safety endpoint incorporated five severe adverse events. We did Bayesian analysis to show the posterior probability that airway bypass was superior to sham control (success threshold, 0·965). Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00391612.</fragment>

The frequency of exacerbations was 1.48 exacerbations per patient-year in the azithromycin group, as compared with 1.83 per patient-year in the placebo group (P=0.01), and the hazard ratio for having an acute exacerbation of COPD per patient-year in the azithromycin group was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.84; P&lt;0.001). The scores on the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (on a scale of 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating better functioning) improved more in the azithromycin group than in the placebo group (a mean [±SD] decrease of 2.8±12.8 vs. 0.6±11.4, P=0.004); the percentage of participants with more than the minimal clinically important difference of -4 units was 43% in the azithromycin group, as compared with 36% in the placebo group (P=0.03). Hearing decrements were more common in the azithromycin group than in the placebo group (25% vs. 20%, P=0.04).</fragment>

			<section label="CONCLUSIONS" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>Among selected subjects with COPD, azithromycin taken daily for 1 year, when added to usual treatment, decreased the frequency of exacerbations and improved quality of life but caused hearing decrements in a small percentage of subjects.

				<fragment>An individualised action plan (AP) is a potentially effective method of helping patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to recognise and anticipate early exacerbation symptoms. This multicentre randomised controlled trial evaluates the hypothesis that individualised APs reduce exacerbation recovery time.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Two hundred and thirty-three patients with COPD (age 65±10 years, forced expiratory volume in 1 s 56±21% predicted) were randomised to receive either an individualised AP (n=111) or care as usual (n=122). The AP provides individualised treatment prescriptions (pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical) related to a colour-coded symptom status to enhance an adequate response to periods of symptom deterioration (reinforced at 1 and 4 months). Exacerbation onset was defined using the Anthonisen symptom diary card algorithm. Every 3 days the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) was assessed to evaluate the longitudinal course of health status. The primary outcome was health status recovery in the event of an exacerbation.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>During the 6-month follow-up period there was no difference in exacerbation rates and healthcare utilisation between the two groups. Cox-adjusted survival analysis including frailty showed enhanced health status recovery (HR 1.58; 95% CI 0.96 to 2.60) and reduced length of the exacerbation (HR 1.30; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.84). The mean difference in symptom recovery time was -3.68 days (95% CI -7.32 to -0.04). Mixed model repeated measure analysis showed that an AP decreased the impact of exacerbations on health status both in the prodromal and early post-onset periods. Between-group differences in CCQ scores were above the minimal clinically relevant difference of 0.4 points (3.0±0.7 vs. 3.4±0.9; p≤0.01).</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>Background Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and COPD severity. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD) and a dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) locus associated with smoking cessation in multiple populations. Objective To identify SNPs associated with lifetime average and current CPD, age at smoking initiation, and smoking cessation in patients with COPD. Methods GWAS were conducted in four independent cohorts encompassing 3441 ever-smoking patients with COPD (Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease stage II or higher). Untyped SNPs were imputed using the HapMap (phase II) panel. Results from all cohorts were meta-analysed. Results Several SNPs near the HLA region on chromosome 6p21 and in an intergenic region on chromosome 2q21 showed associations with age at smoking initiation, both with the lowest p=2×10(-7). No SNPs were associated with lifetime average CPD, current CPD or smoking cessation with p&lt;10(-6). Nominally significant associations with candidate SNPs within cholinergic receptors, nicotinic, alpha 3/5 (CHRNA3/CHRNA5; eg, p=0.00011 for SNP rs1051730) and cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily A, polypeptide 6 (CYP2A6; eg, p=2.78×10(-5) for a non-synonymous SNP rs1801272) regions were observed for lifetime average CPD, however only CYP2A6 showed evidence of significant association with current CPD. A candidate SNP (rs3025343) in DBH was significantly (p=0.015) associated with smoking cessation. Conclusion The authors identified two candidate regions associated with age at smoking initiation in patients with COPD. Associations of CHRNA3/CHRNA5 and CYP2A6 loci with CPD and DBH with smoking cessation are also likely of importance in the smoking behaviours of patients with COPD.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>Aclidinium bromide is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist in development for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment. This 2-part, phase I study evaluated the safety and tolerability of single ascending intravenous (IV) doses of aclidinium to determine its maximum tolerated dose (MTD; part I) and its absolute bioavailability (part II). Healthy male participants (N = 24) were randomized (1:1) in each part: 3-period crossover, placebo-controlled, single-ascending, alternating IV doses of aclidinium (25-400 µg) in part I and 2-period crossover, single-alternating IV and inhaled doses of aclidinium (200 µg) in part II. A ≥7-day washout separated treatment periods. Pharmacokinetic data were collected in both parts. Following IV or inhaled aclidinium, time to reach maximum plasma concentration following drug administration (t(max) ) was 5 to 7 minutes for all doses. After maximum plasma drug concentration (C(max)), aclidinium was rapidly cleared from plasma. Aclidinium absolute bioavailability was &lt;5% following a single inhaled 200-µg dose. Urinary excretion of unchanged aclidinium was very low, with a greater amount of inactive metabolites excreted compared with aclidinium, all of which were recovered within 12 hours postdose. The MTD following IV administration was not reached; all single IV (25-400 µg) and inhaled doses (200 µg) were well tolerated. In conclusion, the low and short-lived bioavailability of aclidinium and the low incidence of systemic side effects contribute to its positive safety and tolerability profile.</fragment>

		<summary>In study samples of subjects with a wide range of COPD severity, a non-linear relationship between pack-years of smoking and FEV(1) is likely. In this setting, approaches that account for this non-linearity can be more powerful and less biased than the more common approach of using total pack-years to model the smoking effect.</summary>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>The identification of gene-by-environment interactions is important for understanding the genetic basis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Many COPD genetic association analyses assume a linear relationship between pack-years of smoking exposure and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)); however, this assumption has not been evaluated empirically in cohorts with a wide spectrum of COPD severity.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>The relationship between FEV(1) and pack-years of smoking exposure was examined in four large cohorts assembled for the purpose of identifying genetic associations with COPD. Using data from the Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Genetic Modifiers Study, the accuracy and power of two different approaches to model smoking were compared by performing a simulation study of a genetic variant with a range of gene-by-smoking interaction effects.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Non-linear relationships between smoking and FEV(1) were identified in the four cohorts. It was found that, in most situations where the relationship between pack-years and FEV(1) is non-linear, a piecewise linear approach to model smoking and gene-by-smoking interactions is preferable to the commonly used total pack-years approach. The piecewise linear approach was applied to a genetic association analysis of the PI*Z allele in the Norway Case-Control cohort and a potential PI*Z-by-smoking interaction was identified (p=0.03 for FEV(1) analysis, p=0.01 for COPD susceptibility analysis).</fragment>

		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>The endurance shuttle walking test (ESWT) has shown good responsiveness to interventions in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the minimal important difference (MID) for this test remains unknown, therefore limiting its interpretability.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Patients with COPD who completed two or more ESWTs following pulmonary rehabilitation (n=132; forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) 48 ± 22%) or bronchodilation (n=69; FEV1 50 ± 12%) rated their performance of the day in comparison with their previous performance on a 7-point scale ranging from -3 (large deterioration) to +3 (large improvement). The relationship between subjective perception of changes and objective changes in performance during the shuttle walk was evaluated.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Following pulmonary rehabilitation, the anchor-based approach did not allow a valid estimation of the MID in the ESWT performance to be obtained.

For the pharmacotherapy data, regression analysis indicated that a 65 s (95% CI 45 to 85) change in endurance time and a 95 m (95% CI 60 to 115) change in walking distance were associated with a 1-point change in the rating of change scale.

				<fragment>Endobronchial valves that allow air to escape from a pulmonary lobe but not enter it can induce a reduction in lobar volume that may thereby improve lung function and exercise tolerance in patients with pulmonary hyperinflation related to advanced emphysema.</fragment>

				<fragment>We compared the safety and efficacy of endobronchial-valve therapy in patients with heterogeneous emphysema versus standard medical care.

We assessed safety on the basis of the rate of a composite of six major complications.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Of 321 enrolled patients, 220 were randomly assigned to receive endobronchial valves (EBV group) and 101 to receive standard medical care (control group). At 6 months, there was an increase of 4.3% in the FEV1 in the EBV group (an increase of 1.0 percentage point in the percent of the predicted value), as compared with a decrease of 2.5% in the control group (a decrease of 0.9 percentage point in the percent of the predicted value). Thus, there was a mean between-group difference of 6.8% in the FEV1 (P=0.005). Roughly similar between-group differences were observed for the 6-minute walk test. At 12 months, the rate of the complications composite was 10.3% in the EBV group versus 4.6% in the control group (P=0.17).

				<fragment>Indacaterol is a long-acting inhaled beta(2)-agonist (LABA) for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

This study compared the efficacy and safety of indacaterol with the twice-daily LABA formoterol and placebo over 1 year.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Patients with moderate to severe COPD were randomised to receive once-daily indacaterol 300 microg (n=437) or 600 microg (n=428), twice-daily formoterol 12 microg (n=435) or placebo (n=432) for 52 weeks in a double-blind double-dummy parallel group study. The primary efficacy variable was forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) measured 24 h postdose after 12 weeks (indacaterol vs placebo). Other outcomes included dyspnoea (transition dyspnoea index, TDI), use of as-needed salbutamol, symptom-based measures recorded on diary cards, exacerbations, health status (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire), BODE index (body mass index, obstruction, dyspnoea, exercise), safety and tolerability.</fragment>

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Indacaterol increased 24 h postdose FEV(1) after 12 weeks by 170 ml (both doses) versus placebo and by 100 ml versus formoterol (all p&lt;0.001).

Symptomatic outcomes were improved compared with placebo with all active treatments, and indacaterol was more effective than formoterol in improving TDI score and reducing the need for as-needed salbutamol.

			<section>
				<fragment>BACKGROUND Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are characterised by increased dyspnoea, reduced quality of life and muscle weakness. Re-exacerbation and hospital admission are common. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) administered after hospital admission for an exacerbation can improve quality of life and exercise capacity. OBJECTIVE To determine whether outpatient post-exacerbation PR (PEPR) could reduce subsequent hospital admission episodes. METHODS Patients admitted to hospital for an exacerbation of COPD were randomised to receive either usual follow-up care (UC) or PEPR after discharge. Hospital admission and emergency department attendances for COPD exacerbations were recorded over a 3-month period and analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Secondary outcomes included exercise capacity and quadriceps strength. RESULTS 60 patients underwent concealed randomisation at the time of their hospital discharge (UC: n=30, mean (SD) age 65 (10) years, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) 52 (22)% predicted; PEPR: n=30, 67(10) years, 52 (20)% predicted). The proportion of patients re-admitted to hospital with an exacerbation was 33% in the UC group compared with 7% in those receiving PEPR (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.72, p=0.02). The proportion of patients that experienced an exacerbation resulting in an unplanned hospital attendance (either admission or review and discharge from the emergency department) was 57% in the UC group and 27% in those receiving PEPR (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.82, p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS Post-exacerbation rehabilitation in COPD can reduce re-exacerbation events that require admission or hospital attendance over a 3-month period.

			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is applicable to a spectrum of thoracic aortic pathology with half of the procedures performed world-wide for indications other than degenerative aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta (DTA). This multicenter, prospective study queried perioperative and one-year results of TEVAR using the commercially available GORE TAG device, in the treatment of acute complicated Type B dissection (cTBD), traumatic aortic tear (TT), and ruptured degenerative aneurysm (RDA) of the DTA.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>This prospective, non-randomized, literature controlled study included 59 patients; cTBD, n = 19; RDA, n = 20; TT, n = 20. The primary end-point was the composite of death and total paraplegia in subjects at &lt;or= 30 days post-treatment compared with a cohort from current literature. Secondary end-points included adverse events related to device, procedural and systemic complications, and one-year survival.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>All 59 patients had successful endoprosthesis deployment. Fifteen of 19 (79%) patients in the cTBD group had either rupture or malperfusion syndromes at presentation. Combined 30-day mortality/paraplegia rate was 13.6% (8/59), with seven (11.9%) deaths (cTBD [3], RDA [3] and TT [1]) and 1 (TT, 1.7%) case of paraplegia. The primary end-point for the TEVAR cohort was significantly lower (P = .008) when compared with a composite literature control of 800 patients (combined 30-day mortality/paraplegia of 29.6%). Thirty-day complications of any nature occurred in 48 (81%) patients; 11 (18.6%) were device related, and 43 (73%) experienced one or more systemic adverse events. Six (10%) patients required additional TEVAR implantations and 3 (5%) patients (one in each pathology group) required conversion to open surgery. Seventeen (29%) patients had endoleaks of any kind or degree through 30 days; cTBD (7), TT (2), RDA (8). Nine patients (15.3%) had perioperative strokes with two resultant deaths. During mean follow-up time of 409 +/- 309 days, an additional 12 patients died, one patient required open conversion (cTBD), and two patients had major device related events. Actuarial survival at one year was 66% (range, 52%-77%) for the entire cohort; (cTBD) 79% (range, 53%-92%), (TT) 79% (range, 53%-92%) and (RDA) 37% (range, 16%-59%). On regression analysis, age at treatment (1.05 [range, 1.01-1.09]; P = .008) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (4.3 [range, 1.3-14.4]; P = .02) were predictive of death at one year.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>The primary purpose of this secondary analysis was to determine whether 103 participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease rated the affective dimension of dyspnea (dyspnea-related anxiety and dyspnea-related distress) separately from the sensory dimension (intensity) during baseline exercise testing conducted as part of a randomized clinical trial. A secondary purpose was to determine if dyspnea-related anxiety and distress were rated distinctly different from other measurements of anxiety. At the end of a 6-minute walk and an incremental treadmill test, participant ratings of the magnitude of dyspnea-related anxiety and distress on the Modified Borg Scale were significantly different from their ratings of the intensity of dyspnea. Dyspnea-related anxiety and distress also appeared to be concepts independent from measures of state anxiety, negative affect, and anxiety before a treadmill test.</fragment>

		<summary/>
		<content>
			<section>
				<fragment>The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling upregulates inflammation and is known to be increased in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The authors assessed the pharmacology of the novel p38 MAPK inhibitor SB-681323 using blood biomarkers in COPD. Seventeen COPD patients (forced expiratory volume in 1 second 50%-80% predicted) using short-acting bronchodilators participated in a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, crossover study. Patients received single oral doses of SB-681323 7.5 mg and 25 mg, prednisolone 10 mg and 30 mg, and placebo. Blood was obtained predose and at 1, 2, 6, and 24 hours postdose. Whole-blood sorbitol-induced phosphorylated (p) heat shock protein (HSP) 27 levels as a marker of p38 pathway activation and lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production were assessed. Both doses of SB-681323, but not prednisolone, significantly (P &lt; .0001) reduced weighted mean (WM) pHSP27 (0-6 hours) by 58% compared with placebo. WM TNF-alpha production (0-24 hours) was significantly reduced compared with placebo by SB-681323 25 mg (40%, P = .005) and 7.5 mg (33.4%, P = .02), while prednisolone 30 mg and 10 mg caused 81.5% and 58.2% suppression, respectively (both P &lt; .0001). SB-681323 inhibited the p38 MAPK pathway to a greater degree than prednisolone did. SB-681323 inhibited TNF-alpha production. SB-681323 is a potent p38 MAPK inhibitor that potentially suppresses inflammation in COPD.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disease with a high prevalence and rapidly increasing incidence rates. The effect of self-treatment of COPD exacerbations on the severity of exacerbations during a 1-year period was examined and a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Patients were randomly allocated to four 2-hour self-management sessions, with or without training in self-treatment of exacerbations.

These provided the data to calculate the frequency of exacerbations, the number of exacerbation days and mean daily severity scores.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Data were analysed for 142 randomised patients (self-treatment: n = 70; control: n = 72). The frequency of exacerbations was identical in both study groups (mean (SD) 3.5 (2.7)).

		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have few options for treatment. The efficacy and safety of the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor roflumilast have been investigated in studies of patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, but not in those concomitantly treated with longacting inhaled bronchodilators. The effect of roflumilast on lung function in patients with COPD that is moderate to severe who are already being treated with salmeterol or tiotropium was investigated.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In two double-blind, multicentre studies done in an outpatient setting, after a 4-week run-in, patients older than 40 years with moderate-to-severe COPD were randomly assigned to oral roflumilast 500 microg or placebo once a day for 24 weeks, in addition to salmeterol (M2-127 study) or tiotropium (M2-128 study). The primary endpoint was change in prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)). Analysis was by intention to treat.

Compared with placebo, roflumilast consistently improved mean prebronchodilator FEV(1) by 49 mL (p&lt;0.0001) in patients treated with salmeterol, and 80 mL (p&lt;0.0001) in those treated with tiotropium. Similar improvement in postbronchodilator FEV(1) was noted in both groups. Furthermore, roflumilast had beneficial effects on other lung function measurements and on selected patient-reported outcomes in both groups. Nausea, diarrhoea, weight loss, and, to a lesser extent, headache were more frequent in patients in the roflumilast groups. These adverse events were associated with increased patient withdrawal.</fragment>

				<fragment>Systemic exposure to anticholinergics used for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may lead to side effects. This study assessed safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of aclidinium bromide, a novel, long-acting antimuscarinic. Sixteen healthy participants received aclidinium bromide 200, 400, or 800 microg or placebo by dry-powder inhaler for 5 days, with &gt; or =7 days washout. Aclidinium bromide and metabolite pharmacokinetics were assessed. Aclidinium bromide plasma levels were below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ: 0.05 ng/mL) after 200 microg and in most participants after 400 microg. Plasma levels in all participants were below the LLOQ at all doses, including the highest dose, beyond 1 hour postdose. AUC(0-t) and C(max) at steady state were, respectively, 0.08 ng.h/mL and 0.12 ng/mL (aclidinium bromide), 0.40 ng.h/mL and 0.14 ng/mL (alcohol metabolite), and 13.47 ng.h/mL and 2.26 ng/mL (acid metabolite). The t(max) for aclidinium bromide 800 microg was 15 minutes (first kinetic time point). Adverse event frequency was comparable between treatment groups and placebo. The most commonly reported adverse events, probably treatment related, were coughing (n = 2) and dysphagia (n = 1); 94% of adverse events were mild. These data suggest a low systemic bioavailability and favorable safety profile for aclidinium bromide with repeated dosing for COPD.</fragment>

				<fragment>Beta-adrenergic stimulation may increase heart rate and the potential for cardiac arrhythmias. The effect of inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) on these outcomes was evaluated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 2 double-blind randomized clinical trials. The pretreatment arrhythmia occurrence frequency in these patients was also described. In this analysis, 24-hour Holter monitoring data were pooled from 2 identically designed Phase III trials. Patients were randomized to LABA treatment or placebo for 12 weeks: a) nebulized arformoterol 15 microg BID, b) 25 microg BID, or c) 50 microg QD; d) salmeterol metered dose inhaler 42 microg BID; or e) placebo. The 24-hour Holter monitoring was performed pretreatment and at Weeks 0 (first day of dosing), 6, and 12. We assessed the proportion of patients with each of 4 arrhythmias: atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and "nonsustained"; (4-10 beats) and "sustained"; (&gt;10 beats) ventricular tachycardia. There were 5226 Holter recordings in 1429 treated patients. At baseline, there was a low frequency of occurrence of atrial fibrillation/flutter (0.1%), nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (3.1%), and &gt;10 beat ventricular tachycardia (0.3%). Atrial tachycardia occurred frequently (41.8%). The proportion of patients with treatment-emergent atrial tachycardia ranged from 27% to 32% and was non-significantly higher, by approximately 2%-5% (p = 0.70), in the LABA groups compared with the placebo group. The rates of the other more serious arrhythmias did not increase with LABA treatment and were similar to placebo. All treatment groups (LABA and placebo) had consistent small decreases from baseline in mean 24-hour and maximum hourly heart rate. In conclusion, in this large cohort of COPD patients with no or stable cardiac comorbidities, a high proportion ( approximately 40%) of patients were observed to have atrial tachycardia before treatment, which increased by 2%-5% with LABA treatment. More serious arrhythmias were infrequent and did not increase with inhaled LABA therapy. LABA administration did not increase mean heart rate.</fragment>

		<summary>In patients with COPD, therapy with tiotropium was associated with improvements in lung function, quality of life, and exacerbations during a 4-year period but did not significantly reduce the rate of decline in FEV(1). (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00144339.)</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Previous studies showing that tiotropium improves multiple end points in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) led us to examine the long-term effects of tiotropium therapy.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In this randomized, double-blind trial, we compared 4 years of therapy with either tiotropium or placebo in patients with COPD who were permitted to use all respiratory medications except inhaled anticholinergic drugs. The patients were at least 40 years of age, with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) of 70% or less after bronchodilation and a ratio of FEV(1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) of 70% or less. Coprimary end points were the rate of decline in the mean FEV(1) before and after bronchodilation beginning on day 30. Secondary end points included measures of FVC, changes in response on St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), exacerbations of COPD, and mortality.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Of a total of 5993 patients (mean age, 65+/-8 years) with a mean FEV(1) of 1.32+/-0.44 liters after bronchodilation (48% of predicted value), we randomly assigned 2987 to the tiotropium group and 3006 to the placebo group. Mean absolute improvements in FEV(1) in the tiotropium group were maintained throughout the trial (ranging from 87 to 103 ml before bronchodilation and from 47 to 65 ml after bronchodilation), as compared with the placebo group (P&lt;0.001). After day 30, the differences between the two groups in the rate of decline in the mean FEV(1) before and after bronchodilation were not significant. The mean absolute total score on the SGRQ was improved (lower) in the tiotropium group, as compared with the placebo group, at each time point throughout the 4-year period (ranging from 2.3 to 3.3 units, P&lt;0.001). At 4 years and 30 days, tiotropium was associated with a reduction in the risks of exacerbations, related hospitalizations, and respiratory failure.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Long-term non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) might improve the outcomes of pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with chronic respiratory failure. A study was undertaken to investigate whether nocturnal NIPPV in addition to pulmonary rehabilitation improves health-related quality of life, functional status and gas exchange compared with pulmonary rehabilitation alone in patients with COPD with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure.</fragment>

			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>72 patients with COPD were randomly assigned to nocturnal NIPPV in addition to rehabilitation (n = 37) or rehabilitation alone (n = 35). Outcome measures were assessed before and after the 3-month intervention period.</fragment>

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>The Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire total score improved 15.1 points with NIPPV + rehabilitation compared with 8.7 points with rehabilitation alone. The difference of 7.5 points was not significant (p = 0.08). However, compared with rehabilitation alone, the difference in the fatigue domain was greater with NIPPV + rehabilitation (mean difference 3.3 points, p&lt;0.01), as was the improvement in the Maugeri Respiratory Failure questionnaire total score (mean difference -10%, p&lt;0.03) and its cognition domain (mean difference -22%, p&lt;0.01). Furthermore, the addition of NIPPV improved daytime arterial carbon dioxide pressure (mean difference -0.3 kPa; p&lt;0.01) and daily step count (mean difference 1269 steps/day, p&lt;0.01). This was accompanied by an increased daytime minute ventilation (mean difference 1.4 l; p&lt;0.001).</fragment>

		<summary>TFS had significantly better quality of life and fewer hospitalisations than patients treated with TP but these improvements in health outcomes were associated with increased costs. Neither TFS nor TS are economically attractive alternatives compared with monotherapy with T.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Little is known about the combination of different medications in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study determined the cost effectiveness of adding salmeterol (S) or fluticasone/salmeterol (FS) to tiotropium (T) for COPD.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>This concurrent, prospective, economic analysis was based on costs and health outcomes from a 52 week randomised study comparing: (1) T 18 microg once daily + placebo twice daily (TP group); (2) T 18 microg once daily + S 25 microg/puff, 2 puffs twice daily (TS group); and (3) T 18 microg once daily + FS 250/25 microg/puff, 2 puffs twice daily (TFS group). The incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were defined as incremental cost per exacerbation avoided, and per additional quality adjusted life year (QALY) between treatments. A combination of imputation and bootstrapping was used to quantify uncertainty, and extensive sensitivity analyses were performed.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>The average patient in the TP group generated CAN$2678 in direct medical costs compared with $2801 (TS group) and $4042 (TFS group). The TS strategy was dominated by TP and TFS. Compared with TP, the TFS strategy resulted in ICERs of $6510 per exacerbation avoided, and $243,180 per QALY gained. In those with severe COPD, TS resulted in equal exacerbation rates and slightly lower costs compared with TP.</fragment>

			<section label="CONCLUSIONS" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>TFS had significantly better quality of life and fewer hospitalisations than patients treated with TP but these improvements in health outcomes were associated with increased costs.
