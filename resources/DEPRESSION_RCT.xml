		<content>
			<section label="PURPOSE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Cancer-related-fatigue (CRF) is common in advanced cancer. The primary objective of the study was to compare the effects of methylphenidate (MP) with those of placebo (PL) on CRF as measured using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) fatigue subscale. The effect of a combined intervention including MP plus a nursing telephone intervention (NTI) was also assessed.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="PATIENTS AND METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Patients with advanced cancer with a fatigue score of ≥ 4 out of 10 on the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) were randomly assigned to one of the following four groups: MP+NTI, PL+NTI, MP + control telephone intervention (CTI), and PL+CTI. Methylphenidate dose was 5 mg every 2 hours as needed up to 20 mg per day. The primary end point was the median difference in FACIT-F fatigue at day 15. Secondary outcomes included anxiety, depression, and sleep.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>One hundred forty-one patients were evaluable. Median FACIT-F fatigue scores improved from baseline to day 15 in all groups: MP+NTI (median score, 4.5; P = .005), PL+NTI (median score, 8.0; P &lt; .001), MP+CTI (median score, 7.0; P = .004), and PL+CTI (median score, 5.0; P = .03). However, there were no significant differences in the median improvement in FACIT-F fatigue between the MP and PL groups (5.5 v 6.0, respectively; P = .69) and among all four groups (P = .16). Fatigue (P &lt; .001), nausea (P = .01), depression (P = .02), anxiety (P = .01), drowsiness (P &lt; .001), appetite (P = .009), sleep (P &lt; .001), and feeling of well-being (P &lt; .001), as measured by the ESAS, significantly improved in patients who received NTI. Grade ≥ 3 adverse events did not differ between MP and PL (40 of 93 patients v 29 of 97 patients, respectively; P = .06).</fragment>

		<summary>This moderately intense exercise programme did not reduce depressive symptoms in residents of care homes. In this frail population, alternative strategies to manage psychological symptoms are required.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Depression is common and is associated with poor outcomes among elderly care-home residents. Exercise is a promising low-risk intervention for depression in this population. We tested the hypothesis that a moderate intensity exercise programme would reduce the burden of depressive symptoms in residents of care homes.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We did a cluster-randomised controlled trial in care homes in two regions in England; northeast London, and Coventry and Warwickshire. Residents aged 65 years or older were eligible for inclusion. A statistician independent of the study randomised each home (1 to 1·5 ratio, stratified by location, minimised by type of home provider [local authority, voluntary, private and care home, private and nursing home] and size of home [&lt;32 or ≥32 residents]) into intervention and control groups. The intervention package included depression awareness training for care-home staff, 45 min physiotherapist-led group exercise sessions for residents (delivered twice weekly), and a whole home component designed to encourage more physical activity in daily life. The control consisted of only the depression awareness training. Researchers collecting follow-up data from individual participants and the participants themselves were inevitably aware of home randomisation because of the physiotherapists' activities within the home. A researcher masked to study allocation coded NHS routine data. The primary outcome was number of depressive symptoms on the geriatric depression scale-15 (GDS-15). Follow-up was for 12 months. This trial is registered with ISRCTN Register, number ISRCTN43769277.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Care homes were randomised between Dec 15, 2008, and April 9, 2010. At randomisation, 891 individuals in 78 care homes (35 intervention, 43 control) had provided baseline data. We delivered 3191 group exercise sessions attended on average by five study participants and five non-study residents. Of residents with a GDS-15 score, 374 of 765 (49%) were depressed at baseline; 484 of 765 (63%) provided 12 month follow-up scores. Overall the GDS-15 score was 0·13 (95% CI -0·33 to 0·60) points higher (worse) at 12 months for the intervention group compared with the control group. Among residents depressed at baseline, GDS-15 score was 0·22 (95% CI -0·52 to 0·95) points higher at 6 months in the intervention group than in the control group. In an end of study cross-sectional analysis, including 132 additional residents joining after randomisation, the odds of being depressed were 0·76 (95% CI 0·53 to 1·09) for the intervention group compared with the control group.</fragment>

				<fragment>We enrolled 570 relatives of patients who were in cardiac arrest and were given CPR by 15 prehospital emergency medical service units. The units were randomly assigned either to systematically offer the family member the opportunity to observe CPR (intervention group) or to follow standard practice regarding family presence (control group). The primary end point was the proportion of relatives with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related symptoms on day 90. Secondary end points included the presence of anxiety and depression symptoms and the effect of family presence on medical efforts at resuscitation, the well-being of the health care team, and the occurrence of medicolegal claims.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>In the intervention group, 211 of 266 relatives (79%) witnessed CPR, as compared with 131 of 304 relatives (43%) in the control group. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the frequency of PTSD-related symptoms was significantly higher in the control group than in the intervention group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 2.5; P=0.004) and among family members who did not witness CPR than among those who did (adjusted odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.5; P=0.02). Relatives who did not witness CPR had symptoms of anxiety and depression more frequently than those who did witness CPR. Family-witnessed CPR did not affect resuscitation characteristics, patient survival, or the level of emotional stress in the medical team and did not result in medicolegal claims.</fragment>

			<section label="PURPOSE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Prior studies have suggested that melatonin, a frequently used integrative medicine, can attenuate weight loss, anorexia, and fatigue in patients with cancer. These studies were limited by a lack of blinding and absence of placebo controls. The primary purpose of this study was to compare melatonin with placebo for appetite improvement in patients with cancer cachexia.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="PATIENTS AND METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We performed a randomized, double-blind, 28-day trial of melatonin 20 mg versus placebo in patients with advanced lung or GI cancer, appetite scores ≥ 4 on a 0 to 10 scale (10 = worst appetite), and history of weight loss ≥ 5%. Assessments included weight, symptoms by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale, and quality of life by the Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy (FAACT) questionnaire. Differences between groups from baseline to day 28 were analyzed using one-sided, two-sample t tests or Wilcoxon two-sample tests. Interim analysis halfway through the trial had a Lan-DeMets monitoring boundary with an O'Brien-Fleming stopping rule. Decision boundaries were to accept the null hypothesis of futility if the test statistic z &lt; 0.39 (P ≥ .348) and reject the null hypothesis if z &gt; 2.54 (P ≤ .0056).</fragment>

				<fragment>Fear and avoidance of activity may play a role in fostering disability in whiplash-associated disorders (WAD). This study examined the role of fear after WAD and assessed the effectiveness of 3 treatments targeting fear. People still symptomatic from WAD grade I-II injuries approximately 3months previously (n=191) completed questionnaires (eg, Neck Disability Index [NDI]) and were randomized to 1 of the treatments: (1) informational booklet (IB) describing WAD and the importance of resuming activities, (2) IB+didactic discussions (DD) with clinicians reinforcing the booklet, and (3) IB+imaginal and direct exposure desensitization (ET) to feared activities. DD and ET participants received three 2-hour treatment sessions. Absolute improvements in NDI were in predicted direction (ET=14.7, DD=11.9, IB=9.9). ETs reported significantly less posttreatment pain severity compared with the IB (Mean=1.5 vs 2.3, P&lt;.001, d=0.6) and DD (M=1.5 vs 2.0, P=.039, d=0.6) groups. Reduction in fear was the most important predictor of improvement in NDI (β=0.30, P&lt;.001), followed by reductions in pain (β=0.20, P=.003) and depression (β=0.18, P=.004). The mediational analysis confirmed that fear reduction significantly mediated the effect of treatment group on outcome. Results highlight the importance of fear in individuals with subacute WAD and suggest the importance of addressing fear via exposure therapy and/or educational interventions to improve function.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Depression is emerging as an independent cardiovascular disease risk factor. We investigated whether treating depression in older participants impacted on arterial stiffness, a known cardiovascular disease risk factor and a clinical marker of arterial aging.</fragment>

			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Seventy-five participants with pulse wave velocity (PWV), the gold standard measure for arterial stiffness, at baseline and at 12-month follow-up were included. Depressed patients were randomized to escitalopram (10mg/d) or to duloxetine (60mg/d). In patients without depression, no antidepressant therapy was started. The psychologist and the doctor measuring PWV were both unaware of antidepressant treatment.</fragment>

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>At study entry, no difference in PWV were observable in the three groups of participants. A significant time × drug interaction term (p &lt; .05) was observed for the impact of antidepressant therapy on PWV by analysis of covariance analysis. After 12 months of therapy, duloxetine treatment resulted in a significant (+21%) and escitalopram treatment in a not significant (6%) PWV increase. These changes in PWV were accompanied by a similar increase in blood pressure and LDL cholesterol in the two treated groups. However, duloxetine resulted in a significant 10% greater heart rate after 12 months that was not observable in participants treated with escitalopram nor in not-depressed older participants. Multiple regression models revealed that a drug-specific effect on PWV persisted after controlling for cardiovascular risk factor levels.</fragment>

				<fragment>This study examined the changes in cortisol levels and psychological distress symptoms of 83 nonclinical subjects receiving a single hour long intervention. Subjects were randomly assigned to either an emotional freedom technique (EFT) group, a psychotherapy group receiving a supportive interviews (SI), or a no treatment (NT) group. Salivary cortisol assays were performed immediately before and 30 minutes after the intervention. Psychological distress symptoms were assessed using the symptom assessment-45. The EFT group showed statistically significant improvements in anxiety (-58.34%, p &lt; 0.05), depression (-49.33%, p &lt; 0.002), the overall severity of symptoms (-50.5%, p &lt; 0.001), and symptom breadth (-41.93%, p &lt; 0.001). The EFT group experienced a significant decrease in cortisol level (-24.39%; SE, 2.62) compared with the decrease observed in the SI (-14.25%; SE, 2.61) and NT (-14.44%; SE, 2.67) groups (p &lt; 0.03). The decrease in cortisol levels in the EFT group mirrored the observed improvement in psychological distress.</fragment>

			<section label="UNLABELLED">
				<fragment>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder in which the pathophysiological mechanisms of the pain and hypersensitivity are incompletely understood. IBS patients frequently complain of pain in body regions somatotopically distinct from the gut, suggesting involvement of central hyperalgesic mechanisms. We tested the role of tonic peripheral impulse input by using both repetitive thermal stimuli to the leg and repetitive stimuli to the rectum. Changes in thermal/visceral pain sensitivity after nociceptive thermal/visceral repetitive stimulation were determined. A subset of IBS patients showed enhanced rectal/thermal pain sensitivity after repetitive thermal/rectal stimulation, respectively. IBS patients then received 60 mg dextromethorphan and placebo (diphenhydramine) in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. The results showed that 1) a subset of IBS patients had increased visceral/cutaneous hypersensitivity following a series of repetitive nociceptive stimuli and that 2) this increased pain sensitivity was blocked by administration of dextromethorphan. This is the first human study indicating that repetitive stimulation enhances a bidirectional mechanism of secondary hyperalgesia due to viscerosomatic facilitation in IBS patients. These unique findings elucidate mechanisms of somatic hypersensitivity in IBS patients and support an etiologic basis for abnormal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor mechanisms that may be the target of future therapies for IBS.</fragment>

				<fragment>Brief measures to assess and monitor pain in cancer patients are available, but few head-to-head psychometric comparisons of different measures have been reported. Baseline and 3-month data were analyzed from 274 patients enrolled in the Indiana Cancer Pain and Depression (INCPAD) trial. Participants completed the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), the PEG (a 3-item abbreviated version of the BPI), the short form (SF)-36 pain scale, and a pain global rating of change measure. The global rating was used as the criterion for standardized response mean and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses.

				<fragment>Interventions based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) are widely used to treat chronic pain, but the brain mechanisms responsible for these treatment effects are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to validate the relevance of the cortical control theory in response to an exposure-based form of CBT, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, in patients with chronic pain. Forty-three female patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia syndrome were enrolled in a randomized, 12-week, waiting-list controlled clinical trial (CBT n=25; controls n=18). CBT was administered in groups of six patients during 12 weekly sessions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during pressure-evoked pain was assessed before and after treatment or the 12-week period. Self-report questionnaires of depression and anxiety were administered pre- and posttreatment as well as 3 months following end of treatment. Patients treated with CBT reported larger improvement of fibromyalgia on the Patient Global Impression of Change measure, and improved depression and anxiety symptoms, compared to the waiting-list controls. However, there were no effects on clinical pain or pain sensitivity measures. An analysis of fMRI scans revealed that CBT led to increased activations in the ventrolateral prefrontal/lateral orbitofrontal cortex; regions associated with executive cognitive control. We suggest that CBT changes the brain's processing of pain through an altered cerebral loop between pain signals, emotions, and cognitions; leading to increased access to executive regions for reappraisal of pain. Our data thereby support our hypothesis about the activation of a cortical control mechanism in response to CBT treatment in chronic pain.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>The objective of this study was to evaluate demographic and psychosocial predictors of attendance in a family-based behavioral weight management clinical trial. Ninety-three children and adolescents aged 7-17 (Mean age = 11.59, s.d. = 2.6) who were either overweight or obese (Mean BMI percentile = 98.2) and their parents received either a 10-session behavioral treatment or a three-session brief family intervention in the context of a randomized clinical trial (10). Psychosocial and anthropometric measures were obtained before enrollment and at the end of 10 weeks for both treatment groups. Univariate linear regression and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to identify predictors of attendance to treatment from an a priori set of hypothesized predictors. Three variables demonstrated significant associations with the dependent variable, percent of treatment sessions attended. Specifically, distance from participant's home to treatment site, lower gross family income, and youth self-report of depressive symptoms were each associated with lower percent attendance (all Ps &lt; 0.05). These results corroborate (i.e., income, depressive symptoms) and expand (i.e., distance from treatment site) previous reports in the literature of potential barriers to effective treatment for pediatric obesity, and suggest the need for research on treatment delivery methods that could increase participation among low-income families (e.g., eHealth, mHealth options). Depressive symptoms could represent an additional barrier to treatment attendance, suggesting that assessment and treatment for these symptoms may be appropriate before commencing weight management treatment.</fragment>

Ninety-six COPD outpatients completed the study (n = 49 in the intervention group; n = 47 in the control group). Over the 10-month study duration, the intervention group received a cognitive behavioral intervention. Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant improvement in uncertainty, coping strategy, anxiety, depression, and the mental health domains of QOL after the intervention, providing the first evidence that uncertainty management can improve the emotional status and QOL of COPD outpatients.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Opioids and antidepressants are frequently prescribed for chronic low back pain (cLBP). This post hoc analysis was conducted to assess the tolerability of oxymorphone extended release (ER) for cLBP in patients taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) compared with patients not taking SSRIs/SNRIs.</fragment>

			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Patients in 2 clinical trials (NCT00225797, November 22, 2004 to July 18, 2005; NCT00226421, October 13, 2004 to August 19, 2005) aged ≥ 18 years with moderate to severe cLBP were titrated to a stabilized dose of oxymorphone ER during an open-label titration phase and then randomized to treatment with this dose or placebo every 12 hours for 12 weeks. In a post hoc analysis, adverse events (AEs) were compared between patients taking versus not taking SSRIs/SNRIs. Treatment efficacy was assessed as change from baseline in average daily pain intensity on a 100-mm visual analog scale.</fragment>

				<fragment>Of 575 patients enrolled, 45 of 89 (50.6%) taking SSRIs/SNRIs and 303 of 486 (62.3%) not taking SSRIs/SNRIs successfully titrated to oxymorphone ER. The frequency of any AE did not differ significantly between the 2 subpopulations. During the titration phase, serious AEs occurred more frequently in patients taking SSRIs/SNRIs (3/89; 3.4%) compared with those not taking SSRIs/SNRIs (4/486; 0.8%; P = 0.04); however, during the double-blind treatment phase, there was no significant difference in the frequency of serious AEs in patients treated with oxymorphone ER taking (1/29; 3.4%) versus those not taking (3/146; 2.0%) SSRIs/SNRIs. Visual analog scale scores were similar in patients taking versus those not taking SSRIs/SNRIs throughout the study.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>This article provides an assessment of the associations that weight-loss patterns during the first year of an intensive lifestyle intervention have with 4-year maintenance and health outcomes. Two components described patterns of weight change during the first year of intervention: one reflected the typical pattern of weight loss over the 12 months, but distinguished those who lost larger amounts across the monthly intervals from those who lost less. The second component reflected the weight change trajectory, and distinguished a pattern of initial weight loss followed by regain vs. a more sustained pattern of weight loss. Two thousand four hundred and thirty eight individuals aged 45-76 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who enrolled in the weight-loss intervention of a randomized clinical trial, were assigned scores according to how their weight losses reflected these patterns. Relationships these scores had with weight losses and health outcomes (glycosolated hemoglobin--hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c); systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, and triglycerides) over 4 years were described. When compared to those with lower scores on the two components, both individuals who had larger month-to-month weight losses in year 1 and whose weight loss was more sustained during the first year had better maintenance of weight loss over 4 years, independent of characteristics traditionally linked to weight loss success (P &lt; 0.001). While relationships with year 4 weight loss were stronger, the pattern of larger monthly weight loss during year 1 was also independently predictive of year 4 levels of HbA1c, HDL-cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>Potential applications of attention bias modification (ABM) for acute and chronic pain patients are investigated. In study 1, 54 acute back pain patients (46 of whom completed the study) were recruited at their initial physiotherapy session and randomised to receive 1 session of ABM or placebo. Patients were followed up 3 months later. Participants who were randomised to receive ABM reported less average (P=0.001) and current pain (P=0.008) and experienced pain for fewer days (P=0.01) than those who received placebo. In study 2, 34 chronic pain patients were recruited and randomly assigned to receive either 4 sessions of ABM (n=22) or placebo (n=12), followed by 8 sessions of cognitive behavioural treatment (CBT). After ABM, there was a significant group-by-time effect for disability. By 6-month follow-up, differences had emerged between the 2 training groups, such that the ABM group had shown greater reductions in anxiety sensitivity and disability than the placebo group. Although the results of these studies show that there is potential in the application of ABM to pain conditions, the mechanisms of treatment could not be established. Neither group showed an initial bias towards the word stimuli or a training effect, and only in the acute pain group were changes in biases related to outcome. Nonetheless, the fact that 2 independent samples showed a positive effect of ABM on clinical outcomes suggests that ABM is worthy of future study as an intervention for pain patients.</fragment>

		<content>
			<section label="CONTEXT" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Decades of randomized controlled trials have produced separate evidence-based treatments for depression, anxiety, and conduct problems in youth, but these treatments are not often used in clinical practice, and they produce mixed results in trials with the comorbid, complex youths seen in practice.

		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Meta-analyses show collaborative care models (CCMs) with nurse care management are effective for improving primary care for depression. This study aimed to develop CCM approaches that could be sustained and spread within Veterans Affairs (VA). Evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI) uses QI approaches within a research/clinical partnership to redesign care. The study used EBQI methods for CCM redesign, tested the effectiveness of the locally adapted model as implemented, and assessed the contextual factors shaping intervention effectiveness.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>The study intervention is EBQI as applied to CCM implementation. The study uses a cluster randomized design as a formative evaluation tool to test and improve the effectiveness of the redesign process, with seven intervention and three non-intervention VA primary care practices in five different states. The primary study outcome is patient antidepressant use. The context evaluation is descriptive and uses subgroup analysis. The primary context evaluation measure is naturalistic primary care clinician (PCC) predilection to adopt CCM.For the randomized evaluation, trained telephone research interviewers enrolled consecutive primary care patients with major depression in the evaluation, referred enrolled patients in intervention practices to the implemented CCM, and re-surveyed at seven months.</fragment>

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Interviewers enrolled 288 CCM site and 258 non-CCM site patients. Enrolled intervention site patients were more likely to receive appropriate antidepressant care (66% versus 43%, p = 0.01), but showed no significant difference in symptom improvement compared to usual care. In terms of context, only 40% of enrolled patients received complete care management per protocol. PCC predilection to adopt CCM had substantial effects on patient participation, with patients belonging to early adopter clinicians completing adequate care manager follow-up significantly more often than patients of clinicians with low predilection to adopt CCM (74% versus 48%%, p = 0.003).</fragment>

		<content>
			<section>
				<fragment>Depressed individuals are frequently excluded from weight loss trials because of fears that weight reduction may precipitate mood disorders, as well as concerns that depressed participants will not lose weight satisfactorily. The present study examined participants in the Look AHEAD study to determine whether moderate weight loss would be associated with incident symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation, and whether symptoms of depression at baseline would limit weight loss at 1 year. Overweight/obese adults with type 2 diabetes (n = 5,145) were randomly assigned to an Intensive Lifestyle Intervention (ILI) or a usual care group, Diabetes Support and Education (DSE). Of these, 5,129 participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and had their weight measured at baseline and 1 year. Potentially significant symptoms of depression were defined by a BDI score ≥10. Participants in ILI lost 8.6 ± 6.9% of initial weight at 1 year, compared to 0.7 ± 4.8% for DSE (P &lt; 0.001, effect size = 1.33), and had a reduction of 1.4 ± 4.7 points on the BDI, compared to 0.4 ± 4.5 for DSE (P &lt; 0.001, effect size = 0.23). At 1 year, the incidence of potentially significant symptoms of depression was significantly lower in the ILI than DSE group (6.3% vs. 9.6%) (relative risk (RR) = 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.5, 0.8; P &lt; 0.001). In the ILI group, participants with and without symptoms of depression lost 7.8 ± 6.7% and 8.7 ± 6.9%, respectively, a difference not considered clinically meaningful. Intentional weight loss was not associated with the precipitation of symptoms of depression, but instead appeared to protect against this occurrence. Mild (or greater) symptoms of depression at baseline did not prevent overweight/obese individuals with type 2 diabetes from achieving significant weight loss.</fragment>

				<fragment>Pain is common among opioid-dependent patients, yet pharmacologic strategies are limited. The aim of this study was to explore whether escitalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, was associated with reductions in pain. The study used longitudinal data from a randomized, controlled trial that evaluated the effects of escitalopram on treatment retention in patients with depressive symptoms who were initiating buprenorphine/naloxone for treatment of opioid dependence. Participants were randomized to receive escitalopram 10 mg or placebo daily. Changes in pain severity, pain interference, and depression were assessed at 1-, 2-, and 3-month visits with the visual analog scale, Brief Pain Inventory, and the Beck Depression Inventory II, respectively. Fixed-effects estimators for panel regression models were used to assess the effects of intervention on changes in outcomes over time. Additional models were estimated to explore whether the intervention effect was mediated by within-person changes in depression. In this sample of 147 adults, we found that participants randomized to escitalopram had significantly larger reductions on both pain severity (b=-14.34, t=-2.66, P&lt;.01) and pain interference (b=-1.20, t=-2.23, P&lt;.05) between baseline and follow-up. After adjusting for within-subject changes in depression, the estimated effects of escitalopram on pain severity and pain interference were virtually identical to the unadjusted effects. This study of opioid-dependent patients with depressive symptoms found that treatment with escitalopram was associated with clinically meaningful reductions in pain severity and pain interference during the first 3 months of therapy.</fragment>

				<fragment>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the prefrontal cortex can cause changes in acute pain perception. Several weeks of daily left prefrontal TMS has been shown to treat depression. We recruited 20 patients with fibromyalgia, defined by American College of Rheumatology criteria, and randomized them to receive 4000 pulses at 10 Hz TMS (n=10), or sham TMS (n=10) treatment for 10 sessions over 2 weeks along with their standard medications, which were fixed and stable for at least 4 weeks before starting sessions. Subjects recorded daily pain, mood, and activity. Blinded raters assessed pain, mood, functional status, and tender points weekly with the Brief Pain Inventory, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire. No statistically significant differences between groups were observed. Patients who received active TMS had a mean 29% (statistically significant) reduction in pain symptoms in comparison to their baseline pain. Sham TMS participants had a 4% nonsignificant change in daily pain from their baseline pain. At 2 weeks after treatment, there was a significant improvement in depression symptoms in the active group compared to baseline. Pain reduction preceded antidepressant effects. TMS was well tolerated, with few side effects. Further studies that address study limitations are needed to determine whether daily prefrontal TMS may be an effective, durable, and clinically useful treatment for fibromyalgia symptoms.</fragment>

		<summary>This study strengthens the evidence for a bidirectional and potentially causative influence of pain and depression on one another. A change in severity of either symptom predicts subsequent severity of the other symptom. Thus, recognition and management of both conditions may be warranted, particularly when treatment focused on 1 condition is not leading to an optimal response.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="UNLABELLED">
				<fragment>Pain and depression are the most prevalent physical and psychological symptom-based disorders, respectively, and co-occur 30 to 50% of the time. However, their reciprocal relationship and potentially causative effects on one another have been inadequately studied. Longitudinal data analysis involving 500 primary care patients with persistent back, hip, or knee pain were enrolled in the Stepped Care for Affective Disorders and Musculoskeletal Pain (SCAMP) study. Half of the participants had comorbid depression and were randomized to a stepped care intervention (n = 123) or treatment as usual (n = 127). Another 250 nondepressed patients with similar pain were followed in a parallel cohort. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Mixed effects model repeated measures (MMRM) multivariable analyses were conducted to determine if change in pain severity predicted subsequent depression severity, and vice versa. Change in pain was a strong predictor of subsequent depression severity (t-value = 6.63, P &lt; .0001). Likewise, change in depression severity was an equally strong predictor of subsequent pain severity (t-value = 7.28, P &lt; .0001). Results from the full cohort were similar in the clinical trial subgroup. In summary, pain and depression have strong and similar effects on one another when assessed longitudinally over 12 months.</fragment>

		<summary/>
		<content>
			<section>
				<fragment>Both clinical and subclinical depression are associated with social impairment; however, few studies have examined the impact of social contact in the daily lives of people with depressive symptoms. The current study used the experience-sampling methodology to examine associations between depressive symptoms, social contact, and daily life impairment in 197 young adults. Depressive symptoms were associated with increased isolation, negative affect, anhedonia, and physical symptoms, decreased positive affect, and social and cognitive impairment in daily life. For people with more depressive symptoms, being with social partners who were perceived as close was associated with greater decreases in negative affect, as well as increases in positive affect. Ironically, participants with depressive symptoms reported spending less time with people whom they perceived as close, minimizing the protective effects of socializing. These results suggest that people experiencing depressive symptoms may be especially sensitive to the nature of social interactions.</fragment>

		<summary>Results suggest that clinicians and investigators might consider targeting sleep, depression and stress as part of a behavioral weight loss intervention.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>The LIFE study is a two-phase randomized clinical trial comparing two approaches to maintaining weight loss following guided weight loss. Phase I provided a nonrandomized intensive 6-month behavioral weight loss intervention to 472 obese (body mass index 30-50) adult participants. Phase II is the randomized weight loss maintenance portion of the study. This paper focuses on Phase I measures of sleep, screen time, depression and stress.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>The Phase I intervention consisted of 22 group sessions led over 26 weeks by behavioral counselors. Recommendations included reducing dietary intake by 500 calories per day, adopting the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern and increasing physical exercise to at least 180 min per week. Measures reported here are sleep time, insomnia, screen time, depression and stress at entry and post-weight loss intervention follow-up.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>The mean weight loss for all participants over the intensive Phase I weight loss intervention was 6.3 kg (s.d. 7.1). Sixty percent (N=285) of participants lost at least 4.5 kg (10 lbs) and were randomized into Phase II. Participants (N=472) attended a mean of 73.1% (s.d. 26.7) of sessions, completed 5.1 (s.d. 1.9) daily food records/week, and reported 195.1 min (s.d. 123.1) of exercise per week. Using logistic regression, sleep time (quadratic trend, P=0.030) and lower stress (P=0.024) at entry predicted success in the weight loss program, and lower stress predicted greater weight loss during Phase I (P=0.021). In addition, weight loss was significantly correlated with declines in stress (P=0.048) and depression (P=0.035).</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>Non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) is a common and distressing condition. Prior studies suggest that psychotropic medication or pain coping skills training (CST) may benefit NCCP patients. To our knowledge, no clinical trials have examined the separate and combined effects of CST and psychotropic medication in the management of NCCP. This randomized clinical trial examined the separate and combined effects of CST and antidepressant medication (sertraline) in participants with non-cardiac chest pain. A sample of individuals diagnosed with NCCP was randomly assigned to one of four treatments: (1) CST plus sertraline (CST+sertraline), (2) CST plus placebo (CST+placebo), (3) sertraline alone, or (4) placebo alone. Assessments of pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, anxiety, pain catastrophizing, depression, and physical disability were collected prior to treatment, and at 10- and 34-weeks following randomization. Data analyses revealed that CST and sertraline either alone or in combination significantly reduced pain intensity and pain unpleasantness. The combination of CST plus sertraline may have the greatest promise in that, when compared to placebo alone, it not only significantly reduced pain but also pain catastrophizing and anxiety. Overall, these findings support the importance of further research on the effects of CST and sertraline for non-cardiac chest pain.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>The mechanism or mechanisms involved in the development of pain-related disability in people with low back pain is unclear. Psychological distress has been identified as one potential pathway by which an episode of pain influences the development of persistent disabling symptoms; however, the relationship has not been formally investigated. This study investigated the causal relationship between pain and disability via psychological distress (and its components depression, stress, and anxiety) by using mediation path analysis. The study sample included 231 participants with subacute low back pain (6 to 12 weeks' pain duration) who had been recruited for an exercise-based randomised, controlled trial. All participants completed self-report assessments of pain (0-10 numerical rating scale), disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire), and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale) at baseline and again at 2 follow-up time points (6 and 12 weeks after baseline). The results of the mediation analysis suggest that approximately 30% of the relationship between subacute pain and later disability is dependent on the level of patients' psychological distress. The finding that psychological distress only partially (30%) mediated the pain-disability relationship indicates that other factors should also be explored. Further analysis into the components of psychological distress revealed that the symptoms of depression and stress, but not anxiety, are responsible for mediation of the pain-disability relationship. These findings provide an opportunity to decrease the risk of long-term disability through early identification and management of depressive and stress symptoms.</fragment>

				<fragment>A single-blind randomized controlled effectiveness trial at 3 Veterans Affairs HIV clinics (HIV Translating Initiatives for Depression Into Effective Solutions [HITIDES]). The HITIDES intervention consisted of an off-site HIV depression care team (a registered nurse depression care manager, pharmacist, and psychiatrist) that delivered up to 12 months of collaborative care backed by a Web-based decision support system. Participants who completed the baseline telephone interview were 249 HIV-infected patients with depression, of whom 123 were randomized to the intervention and 126 to usual care. Participant interview data were collected at baseline and at the 6- and 12-month follow-up visits. The primary outcome was depression severity measured using the 20-item Hopkins Symptom Checklist (SCL-20) and reported as treatment response (≥50% decrease in SCL-20 item score), remission (mean SCL-20 item score, &lt;0.5), and depression-free days. Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life, health status, HIV symptom severity, and antidepressant or HIV medication regimen adherence.</fragment>

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Intervention participants were more likely to report treatment response (33.3% vs 17.5%) (odds ratio, 2.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37-4.56) and remission (22.0% vs 11.9%) (2.25; 1.11-4.54) at 6 months but not 12 months. Intervention participants reported more depression-free days during the 12 months (β = 19.3; 95% CI, 10.9-27.6; P &lt; .001). Significant intervention effects were observed for lowering HIV symptom severity at 6 months (β = -2.6; 95% CI, -3.5 to -1.8; P &lt; .001) and 12 months (β = -0.82; -1.6 to -0.07; P = .03).

		<content>
			<section label="PURPOSE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Numerous studies have examined the comorbidity of depression with cancer, and some have indicated that depression may be associated with cancer progression or survival. However, few studies have assessed whether changes in depression symptoms are associated with survival.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In a secondary analysis of a randomized trial of supportive-expressive group therapy, 125 women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) completed a depression symptom measure (Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale [CES-D]) at baseline and were randomly assigned to a treatment group or to a control group that received educational materials. At baseline and three follow-up points, 101 of 125 women completed a depression symptom measure. We used these data in a Cox proportional hazards analysis to examine whether decreasing depression symptoms over the first year of the study (the length of the intervention) would be associated with longer survival.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Median survival time was 53.6 months for women with decreasing CES-D scores over 1 year and 25.1 months for women with increasing CES-D scores. There was a significant effect of change in CES-D over the first year on survival out to 14 years (P = .007) but no significant interaction between treatment condition and CES-D change on survival. Neither demographic nor medical variables explained this association.</fragment>

		<summary>Antidepressant medication treatment increases viral suppression among persons with HIV. This effect is likely attributable to improved adherence to a continuum of HIV care, including increased uptake and adherence to antiretroviral therapy.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="CONTEXT" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Depression strongly predicts nonadherence to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antiretroviral therapy, and adherence is essential to maintaining viral suppression. This suggests that pharmacologic treatment of depression may improve virologic outcomes. However, previous longitudinal observational analyses have inadequately adjusted for time-varying confounding by depression severity, which could yield biased estimates of treatment effect. Application of marginal structural modeling to longitudinal observation data can, under certain assumptions, approximate the findings of a randomized controlled trial.</fragment>

		<summary>Given that clinical pain correlated with nociceptive responsiveness, our findings support the mechanistic role of CS in fibromyalgia.

		<content>
			<section label="UNLABELLED">
				<fragment>The role of central sensitization (CS) in clinical pain reported by FMS patients is unclear. In this report, we sought to establish evidence of a prospective association between clinical pain and an objective measure of spinal nociception (nociceptive flexion reflex [NFR] threshold) and explore whether depression moderates this relationship. We collected measures that included the NFR threshold (in the range of 0-60 milliamperes (mA); a lower threshold represents greater nociceptive responsivity) and clinical variables (ie, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ)-total, FIQ-pain, depression and current pain intensity) at 3 time points (baseline, weeks 6 and 12). Using linear mixed effects models, clinical variables were treated as time-varying covariates. Across time, current pain intensity [estimate -1.79 mA (.8), P = .03] and the presence of depression [estimate -6.30 mA (3.2), P = .059] were significantly associated with NFR threshold. The interaction of current pain intensity and depression was also significantly associated with NFR threshold. Specifically, the relationship between current pain intensity and NFR threshold was present in the nondepressed group but not in the depressed group (estimate -3.9 versus .07, P = .01). Both FIQ-total and FIQ-pain were not associated with NFR threshold. In conclusion, higher level of clinical pain intensity correlated with greater nociceptive responsivity, and that depression moderated this association.</fragment>

			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Patients were randomly assigned to undergo hemodialysis six times per week (frequent hemodialysis, 125 patients) or three times per week (conventional hemodialysis, 120 patients) for 12 months. The two coprimary composite outcomes were death or change (from baseline to 12 months) in left ventricular mass, as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and death or change in the physical-health composite score of the RAND 36-item health survey. Secondary outcomes included cognitive performance; self-reported depression; laboratory markers of nutrition, mineral metabolism, and anemia; blood pressure; and rates of hospitalization and of interventions related to vascular access.</fragment>

				<fragment>Patients in the frequent-hemodialysis group averaged 5.2 sessions per week; the weekly standard Kt/V(urea) (the product of the urea clearance and the duration of the dialysis session normalized to the volume of distribution of urea) was significantly higher in the frequent-hemodialysis group than in the conventional-hemodialysis group (3.54±0.56 vs. 2.49±0.27). Frequent hemodialysis was associated with significant benefits with respect to both coprimary composite outcomes (hazard ratio for death or increase in left ventricular mass, 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46 to 0.82; hazard ratio for death or a decrease in the physical-health composite score, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.92).

			<section>
				<fragment>Little is known about binge eating (BE) in adolescents. The primary aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between BE and weight loss in adolescents (BMI ≥95th percentile) enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of behavioral and pharmacologic treatment of obesity. Participants were 82 treatment-seeking adolescents (BMI = 37.9 ± 3.8 kg/m(2); age = 14.1 ± 1.2 years; 67% females; 42% African American, 55% white). Participants completed the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), the Piers Harris Self-Esteem Questionnaire, and the Eating Inventory (including cognitive restraint, disinhibition, and hunger scales). BE was assessed by a questionnaire and a confirmatory interview. At baseline, 24% of participants met criteria for BE (N = 13 met full BE disorder (BED) criteria; N = 7 met subthreshold BE). There were no significant differences in percentage reduction in initial BMI between participants with or without BE at month 6 (-7.0 ± 1.6 vs. -6.9 ± 0.9%) or month 12 (-8.8 ± 2.4 vs. -8.3 ± 1.3%) (omnibus main effect BE P = 0.89, interaction BE × time P = 0.84, interaction BE × drug P = 0.61). The rate of BE declined significantly over time from 24% (n = 20) at baseline to 8% (n = 6) at month 6 and 3% (n = 2) at month 12 (P = 0.003). There were significant decreases in hunger and disinhibition as well as an increase in cognitive restraint over time (all P ≤ 0.0001). Findings suggest a combination of behavioral and pharmacologic therapy may produce both weight loss and improvement in BE.</fragment>

Patients were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) minimal screening: the distress thermometer (DT) only plus usual care; (2) full screening: DT, problem checklist, Psychological Screen for Cancer part C measuring anxiety and depression, a personalized report summarizing concerns and the report on the medical file; or (3) triage: full screening plus optional personalized phone triage with referral to resources. Patients in all conditions received an information packet and were reassessed 3 months later with the full screening battery.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Five hundred eighty-five patients with breast cancer and 549 patients with lung cancer were assessed at baseline (89% of all patients), and 75.5% retained for follow-up. High prevalence of baseline distress was found across patients. Twenty percent fewer patients with lung cancer in triage continued to have high distress at follow-up compared to those in the other two groups, and patients with breast cancer in the full screening and triage conditions showed lower distress at follow-up than those in minimal screening. The best predictor of decreased anxiety and depression in full screening and triage conditions was receiving a referral to psychosocial services.</fragment>

			<section label="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>Routine online screening is feasible in a large cancer center and may help to reduce future distress levels, particularly when coupled with uptake of appropriate resources.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most widely prescribed treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). Although it has been shown to improve the symptoms of OSAS, many patients have difficulty adhering to this treatment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of an automated telemedicine intervention to improve adherence to CPAP.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A randomised clinical trial was undertaken in 250 patients being started on CPAP therapy for OSAS. Patients were randomly assigned to use a theory-driven interactive voice response system designed to improve CPAP adherence (telephone-linked communications for CPAP (TLC-CPAP), n=124) or to an attention placebo control (n=126) for 12 months. TLC-CPAP monitors patients' self-reported behaviour and CPAP-related symptoms and provides feedback and counselling through a structured dialogue to enhance motivation to use CPAP. A Sleep Symptoms Checklist, the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale and the Psychomotor Vigilance Task were administered at study entry and at 6-month and 12-month follow-up. Hours of CPAP usage at effective mask pressure were measured by the CPAP device stored in its memory and retrieved at each visit.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Median observed CPAP use in patients randomised to TLC-CPAP was approximately 1 h/night higher than in the control subjects at 6 months and 2 h/night higher at 12 months. Using generalised estimating equation modelling, the intervention had a significant effect on CPAP adherence. For secondary analysis, the effect of CPAP adherence on the secondary outcomes was analysed. CPAP adherence was significantly associated with a greater reduction in sleep apnoea symptoms and depressive symptoms and a greater improvement in functional status. No significant association was observed between CPAP adherence and reaction time.</fragment>

			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is often much reduced among individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), and incidences of depression, fatigue, and anxiety are high.

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer have a substantial symptom burden and may receive aggressive care at the end of life.

		<summary/>
		<content>
			<section>
				<fragment>This multi-center study compared the therapeutic effect of a cognitive-behavioral minimal contact program (MCT) to the effect of a brochure (bibliotherapy) for the prevention of medication overuse headache (MOH) in migraine patients. Seven German headache centers recruited 182 migraine patients with high triptan or analgesic intake frequency. Patients were randomly allocated to either the MCT-group, receiving both an MCT program and an educational brochure or to the biblio-group receiving only the brochure. All participants continued usual medical treatment. Course of headaches, intake of analgesics or triptans after training, 3 months post-training as well as 1-2 years (mean 15.7 months) later and psychological variables were defined as outcome variables. A significant decline was observed in the number of headache days (11.0-8.8), migraine days (7.3-5.7) and medication intake days (7.4-6.1) from pre to post in the MCT-group (p&lt;0.001 each) and in the biblio-group (p&lt;0.001 each). The pre-to-post-improvements were maintained from pre- to short- and from pre- to long-term follow-up (p&lt;0.001 each) in both groups. Both groups improved significantly from pre to post in psychological variables, e.g. pain acceptance: p&lt;0.001; pain catastrophizing: p&lt;0.001; functional pain coping: p&lt;0.001; and pain related internal control beliefs: p&lt;0.01. Psychological improvements remained stable in both groups at short- and long-term follow-up. During the study, none of the patients developed an MOH. MCT- and bibliotherapy are useful in migraine patients to prevent medication overuse headache or the transition of episodic to chronic headache.</fragment>

		<content>
			<section>
				<fragment>The purpose of this study was to determine whether a brief (6-8 sessions) cognitive-behavioral treatment for temporomandibular dysfunction-related pain could be efficacious in reducing pain, pain-related interference with lifestyle and depressive symptoms. The patients were 101 men and women with pain in the area of the temporomandibular joint of at least 3 months duration, randomly assigned to either standard treatment (STD; n=49) or standard treatment+cognitive-behavioral skills training (STD+CBT; n=52). Patients were assessed at posttreatment (6 weeks), 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36 weeks, and 52 weeks. Linear mixed model analyses of reported pain indicated that both treatments yielded significant decreases in pain, with the STD+CBT condition resulting in steeper decreases in pain over time compared to the STD condition. Somatization, self-efficacy and readiness for treatment emerged as significant moderators of outcome, such that those low in somatization, or higher in self-efficacy or readiness, and treated with STD+CBT reported of lower pain over time. Somatization was also a significant moderator of treatment effects on pain-related interference with functioning, with those low on somatization reporting of less pain interference over time when treated in the STD+CBT condition. It was concluded that brief treatments can yield significant reductions in pain, life interference and depressive symptoms in TMD sufferers, and that the addition of cognitive-behavioral coping skills will add to efficacy, especially for those low in somatization, or high in readiness or self-efficacy.</fragment>

		<summary>This study demonstrated that a modified, gender-tailored CR program reduced depressive symptoms in women when compared to a traditional program. To the extent that depression hinders CR adherence, such tailored programs have potential to improve outcomes for women by maximizing adherence. Future studies should explore the mechanism by which such programs produce benefits.</summary>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Depression is known to co-occur with coronary heart disease (CHD). Depression may also inhibit the effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs by decreasing adherence. Higher prevalence of depression in women may place them at increased risk for non-adherence.</fragment>

				<fragment>A two-group randomized clinical trial compared depressive symptoms of women in a traditional 12-week CR program to those completing a tailored program that included motivational interviewing guided by the Transtheoretical Model of behavior change. Women in the experimental group also participated in a gender-tailored exercise protocol that excluded men. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale was administered to 225 women at baseline, post-intervention, and at 6-month follow-up. Analysis of Variance was used to compare changes in depression scores over time.</fragment>

A significant group by time interaction was found for CES-D scores (F(2, 446)=4.42, p=.013). Follow-up tests revealed that the CES-D scores for the traditional group did not differ over time (F(2, 446)=2.00, p=.137).

To the extent that depression hinders CR adherence, such tailored programs have potential to improve outcomes for women by maximizing adherence. Future studies should explore the mechanism by which such programs produce benefits.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Patients were recruited from the Dorothy P. and Richard P. Simmons Center for Interstitial Lung Disease, located within the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis results in scarring of the lung and respiratory failure, and has a median survival of 3 to 5 years from the time of diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and their care partners could be more optimally managed by a disease-management intervention entitled "Program to Reduce Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Symptoms and Improve Management," which nurses delivered using the format of a support group. We hypothesized that participation would improve perceptions of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and decrease symptom burden.</fragment>

				<fragment>Subjects were 42 participants randomized to an experimental (10 patient/care partner dyads) or control (11 patient/care partner dyads) group. Experimental group participants attended the 6-week program, and controls received usual care. Before and after the program, all participants completed questionnaires designed to assess symptom burden and HRQoL.

Both participants and data assessors were blinded to the study hypothesis. The primary outcome measure was the change in the self-reported depressive symptom severity, measured by the BDI-II. The secondary outcome was the change in the Patient Health Questionnaure-9 (PHQ-9)-assessed depressive symptom severity. Depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline and post-test in both groups.

			<section>
				<fragment>The authors have examined the effects of coaching sensory self-monitoring and reporting on pain-related variables in patients with lung cancer. Randomly assigned to coached or not-coached groups, 215 patients have their interactions with their providers audiotaped and complete study measures pre- and postintervention. Of the 151 patients who complete the 4-week study, those coached are more likely than those not coached to give their providers unsolicited sensory pain information and to mention it before their providers ask for it. The mean number of pain parameters discussed during the audiotaped clinic visit is statistically larger at study end for the coached group. Scores for analgesic adequacy, all pain indices except one, anxiety, depression, and catastrophizing coping are not significantly different. Although coaching increases the amount of pain data communicated to providers by patients with lung cancer, the magnitude is small and does not lead to improved adequacy of analgesics prescribed for each patient's pain level.</fragment>

				<fragment>The purpose of this study was to assess ethnic differences in use of psychotherapy (having met at least once with a psychotherapist) for late-life depression in primary care. Participants were identified through a two-stage, age-stratified (60-74, &gt; or =75) depression screening of randomly sampled patients from 20 practices in New York City, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh in a practice-randomized trial. Practices were randomly assigned to usual care or to an intervention with a depression care manager who worked with primary care physicians to provide algorithm-based care. Depression status based on clinical interview and any use of psychotherapy within the 2-year follow-up interval were the primary dependent variables under study. The focus was on 582 persons with complete data. Participants were sorted into major depression (n=385, 112 African American and 273 white) and clinically significant minor depression (n=197, 51 African American and 146 white) based on clinical diagnostic assessment. Persons who self-identified as African American were less likely than whites to use interpersonal therapy (IPT) if they had minor depression, even after adjusting for potentially influential variables including age, cognitive functioning, and whether the dose of antidepressant was adequate (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.06-0.80). Ethnicity was not significantly associated with IPT use in persons with major depression (AOR=0.71, 95% CI=0.37-1.37). Older African Americans with minor depression were less likely than whites to use psychotherapy. Targeted strategies are needed to mitigate the disparity in use of psychotherapy.</fragment>

Eighty Early Head Start Latina mothers with limited English language proficiency were randomized to an advanced practice nurse-delivered, culturally tailored, in-home psychotherapy intervention, or to usual care. Repeated measures regression analysis showed a significantly greater decrease in depressive symptoms for intervention mothers compared to the usual care group at 22 and 26 weeks (4 weeks post intervention). Intervention mothers' reports of their child's aggression diminished significantly from T1 to T4 compared to usual care mothers (p = .03). Self-efficacy appeared to only partially mediate the intervention effect, and maternal health moderated the intervention impact.

		<updated>2010-05-04</updated>
		<summary>This article presents a new, noninvasive therapeutic approach to chronic, central neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis, poorly responsive to current conventional medications. tDCS is known to cause long-lasting changes of neuronal excitability at the site of stimulation and in the connected areas in healthy subjects. This led us to hypothesize that pain decrease may be the result of functional plastic changes in brain structures involved in the pathogenesis of chronic neuropathic pain.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="UNLABELLED">
				<fragment>Neuropathic pain in patients with MS is frequent and is associated with a great interference with daily life activities. In the present study, we investigated whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may be effective in reducing central chronic pain in MS patients. Patients received sham tDCS or real tDCS in a 5-day period of treatment in a randomized, double blind, sham-controlled study. Pain was measured using visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and the short form McGill questionnaire (SF-MPQ). Quality of life was measured using the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 scale (MSQoL-54). Depressive symptoms and anxiety were also evaluated as confounding factors using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and VAS for anxiety. Evaluations were performed at baseline, immediately after the end of treatment, and once a week during a 3-week follow-up period. Following anodal but not sham tDCS over the motor cortex, there was a significant pain improvement as assessed by VAS for pain and McGill questionnaire, and of overall quality of life. No depression or anxiety changes were observed. Our results show that anodal tDCS is able to reduce pain-scale scores in MS patients with central chronic pain and that this effect outlasts the period of stimulation, leading to long-lasting clinical effects.</fragment>

			<section label="PERSPECTIVE" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>This article presents a new, noninvasive therapeutic approach to chronic, central neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis, poorly responsive to current conventional medications. tDCS is known to cause long-lasting changes of neuronal excitability at the site of stimulation and in the connected areas in healthy subjects. This led us to hypothesize that pain decrease may be the result of functional plastic changes in brain structures involved in the pathogenesis of chronic neuropathic pain.</fragment>

		<summary>The TCW model holds some promise; however, additional work in at-risk populations is required before we recommend implementation.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="PURPOSE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Patients with cancer experience considerable symptom burden, psychological morbidity, and unmet psychosocial needs. Research suggests that feedback of patient-reported outcomes to clinicians or caseworkers, alongside management strategies, may result in improved patient functioning. Two intervention models were developed to test this effect in a randomized, controlled trial against usual care (UC): a telephone caseworker (TCW) model and an oncologist/general practitioner (O/GP) model. Primary end points included anxiety, depression, physical/emotional functioning, and unmet supportive care needs.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="PATIENTS AND METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Participants with nonlocalized breast or colorectal cancers were surveyed by computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) at three time points: baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Data collected from participant CATIs in the supportive care models were used to generate feedback to either each participant's designated TCW, or their nominated O/GPs. Data obtained from participants in the UC model were used only to assess the impact of supportive care models. In total, 356 participants consented to study participation, completed the baseline CATI, and were randomly assigned to the UC, TCW, or O/GP groups.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>No overall intervention effect was observed. Physical functioning was significantly improved at the third CATI for participants in the TCW model (P = .01), and there was a trend toward fewer participants with unmet needs (P = .07). TCW group participants also were more likely to have the following: identified issues of need discussed (P &lt; .0001); referrals made (P &lt; .0001); and strong agreement that the intervention improved communication with their health care team (P = .0005).</fragment>

				<fragment>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions show promise for decreasing chronic pain in youth. However, the availability of CBT is limited by many factors including distance to major treatment centers and expense. This study evaluates a more accessible treatment approach for chronic pediatric pain using an Internet-delivered family CBT intervention. Participants included 48 children, aged 11-17 years, with chronic headache, abdominal, or musculoskeletal pain and associated functional disability, and their parents. Children were randomly assigned to a wait-list control group or an Internet treatment group. Primary treatment outcomes were pain intensity ratings (0-10 NRS) and activity limitations on the Child Activity Limitations Interview, both completed via an online daily diary. In addition to their medical care, the Internet treatment group completed 8 weeks of online modules including relaxation training, cognitive strategies, parent operant techniques, communication strategies, and sleep and activity interventions. Youth randomized to the wait-list control group continued with the current medical care only. Findings demonstrated significantly greater reduction in activity limitations and pain intensity at post-treatment for the Internet treatment group and these effects were maintained at the three-month follow-up. Rate of clinically significant improvement in pain was also greater for the Internet treatment group than for the wait-list control group. There were no significant group differences in parental protectiveness or child depressive symptoms post-treatment. Internet treatment was rated as acceptable by all children and parents. Findings support the efficacy and acceptability of Internet delivery of family CBT for reducing pain and improving function among children and adolescents with chronic pain.</fragment>

				<fragment>Pain is a common cause of disability in osteoarthritis. Duloxetine, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), has demonstrated analgesic effects in diabetic peripheral neuropathy and fibromyalgia. Considering its central mechanism of action, duloxetine may be effective in other pain states with evidence of central sensitization. Herein, we report the results of a 13-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of duloxetine (60-120 mg/day) versus placebo in the treatment of knee pain in 231 patients meeting clinical and radiographic criteria for osteoarthritis of the knee. Duloxetine was superior to placebo on the primary efficacy measure (weekly mean 24-h pain scores) beginning at Week 1 and continuing through the treatment period (P &lt; or = .05). There was also a significant improvement in the WOMAC physical functioning subscale and several other secondary outcomes. Adverse-event rates did not differ significantly between treatment groups (49.5% for duloxetine 60-120 mg/day, and 40.8% for placebo).</fragment>

		<summary>The disclosure of APOE genotyping results to adult children of patients with Alzheimer's disease did not result in significant short-term psychological risks. Test-related distress was reduced among those who learned that they were APOE epsilon4-negative. Persons with high levels of emotional distress before undergoing genetic testing were more likely to have emotional difficulties after disclosure. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00571025.)</summary>

				<fragment>The apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype provides information on the risk of Alzheimer's disease, but the genotyping of patients and their family members has been discouraged. We examined the effect of genotype disclosure in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial.</fragment>

			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We randomly assigned 162 asymptomatic adults who had a parent with Alzheimer's disease to receive the results of their own APOE genotyping (disclosure group) or not to receive such results (nondisclosure group). We measured symptoms of anxiety, depression, and test-related distress 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year after disclosure or nondisclosure.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>There were no significant differences between the two groups in changes in time-averaged measures of anxiety (4.5 in the disclosure group and 4.4 in the nondisclosure group, P=0.84), depression (8.8 and 8.7, respectively; P=0.98), or test-related distress (6.9 and 7.5, respectively; P=0.61). Secondary comparisons between the nondisclosure group and a disclosure subgroup of subjects carrying the APOE epsilon4 allele (which is associated with increased risk) also revealed no significant differences. However, the epsilon4-negative subgroup had a significantly lower level of test-related distress than did the epsilon4-positive subgroup (P=0.01). Subjects with clinically meaningful changes in psychological outcomes were distributed evenly among the nondisclosure group and the epsilon4-positive and epsilon4-negative subgroups. Baseline scores for anxiety and depression were strongly associated with post-disclosure scores of these measures (P&lt;0.001 for both comparisons).</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the effect of integrative reminiscence on depressive symptoms in older African Americans. Fifty-six community-dwelling participants from a northeast urban setting were randomized into a reminiscence intervention group (n = 19), attention control group (health education; n = 19), or true control group (n = 18). Data were collected pre- and posttest using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Significant differences were found between groups, F(2, 52) = 8.6, p = .001, eta(2) = .10. Using Holm's method of post hoc analysis, the mean score for the reminiscence group was 6.8 (SD = 4.7), significantly different from the control group 14.6 (SD = 10.1) and the health education group 11.7 (SD = 7.1). Findings demonstrate that integrative reminiscence has a positive effect on decreasing depressive symptoms in older African Americans.</fragment>

		<summary>Propranolol given immediately after splint removal in anxious, unhappy cosmetic surgery patients may prevent postsurgical dissatisfaction syndrome. A double-blind study appears warranted.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Rhinoplasty patients are commonly anxious about their result when the splint is removed. A small group of them, however, are overtly unhappy with their appearance despite objectively satisfactory early results, cannot be reassured about their favorable long-term prognosis, and remain dissatisfied despite objectively satisfactory end results. The authors have termed this symptom complex "postsurgical dissatisfaction syndrome." In these patients, it seems that persistence of the original negative image of their appearance at the time of splint removal fails to yield to an improved self-image as healing progresses.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>The authors theorized that the syndrome is analogous to the persistence of negative emotional memories seen in posttraumatic stress disorder. In trauma-exposed patients, the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol, when given within a few hours of the traumatic event, may reduce the subsequent emotional strength of the traumatic memory. The authors hypothesized that giving propranolol to postrhinoplasty patients with the above early symptomatology would reduce the likelihood of postsurgical dissatisfaction syndrome.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>A retrospective review of 1000 consecutive rhinoplasty patients identified 11 with early symptomatology. Of these 11 (not taking propranolol), nine (82 percent) developed postsurgical dissatisfaction syndrome. In addition, a prospective study was performed of nine additional patients with the same early symptomatology who were immediately treated with propranolol. In contrast, only three developed postsurgical dissatisfaction syndrome (p &lt; 0.04). Results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 50 additional postrhinoplasty patients suggests that propranolol's effect is not due to anxiolysis.</fragment>

		<summary>Patients who received pharmaceutical care with traditional patient care showed significantly better compliance with their immunosuppressive medication than patients who received only traditional patient care. Pharmaceutical care proved to be an effective intervention that should be implemented in posttransplant care.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="INTRODUCTION" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Compliance with immunosuppressive therapy plays a major role in the long-term success of organ transplantation. Thus, strategies to promote compliance in posttransplant care are of particular interest. At the pharmacy department of the University Hospital Mainz, a program for pharmaceutical care of organ transplant patients has been developed for the first time ever. The main objective of the presented study was to examine the influence of this program on liver transplant patients' compliance with immunosuppressive therapy.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>To measure compliance, medication event monitoring systems were used. Dosing compliance (DC) was calculated for each patient and the mean DC was compared between the two groups. Further direct and indirect methods of measuring compliance served to confirm the electronic compliance data.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Pharmaceutical care of liver transplant patients led to a significant increase in compliance with the immunosuppressive therapy. The mean DC of the intervention group was 90%+/-6% compared with 81%+/-12% in the control group (P=0.015). Only two patients (10%) in the intervention group and nine patients (43%) in the control group showed a DC less than 80% (P=0.032). Furthermore, patients in the intervention group were more likely to achieve target blood levels.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>Patients who received pharmaceutical care with traditional patient care showed significantly better compliance with their immunosuppressive medication than patients who received only traditional patient care. Pharmaceutical care proved to be an effective intervention that should be implemented in posttransplant care.</fragment>

		<content>
			<section>
				<fragment>Patients given implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) after arrhythmic events or sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) experience psychosocial distress. ICDs now are inserted for the primary prevention of SCA in patients with heart failure; the psychosocial impact of ICDs on patients with heart failure is unknown. Changes in psychosocial status in these ICD recipients were examined. ICD recipients (n = 57) completed depression, anxiety, and social support inventories every 6 months for up to 2 years. Initially, 35% of recipients were depressed and 45% of recipients were anxious. In linear mixed models, depression decreased over time overall but increased in those who experienced ICD shocks. Anxiety decreased in New York Heart Association class III ICD recipients but not in class II ICD recipients. Decreases in social support were related to age: the younger the patient the greater the decrease. A significant proportion of ICD recipients were depressed or anxious, or had diminished social support even after 2 years. Investigation of strategies to improve ICD recipients' psychosocial status is warranted.</fragment>

			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>To evaluate the presence and nature of patterns of coherency among the motor and non-motor domains in Parkinson's disease (PD) and to examine which clinical parameters are related to the potential patterns.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A cohort of 397 patients with PD were randomly divided into two samples. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed on the motor and non-motor symptoms in PD in the first sample. Findings of the EFA were used to construct a model which was tested in the second sample by confirmatory factor analysis. Multiple regression analyses on the resulting factors were performed to evaluate the influence of clinical parameters on these factors.</fragment>

				<fragment>Recent studies of rimonabant have re-awakened interest in the possible adverse psychiatric effects of weight loss, as well as of weight loss medications. This study examined changes in symptoms of depression in 194 obese participants (age = 43.7 +/- 10.2 years; BMI = 37.6 +/- 4.1 kg/m(2)) in a 1-year randomized trial of lifestyle modification and medication. Participants were assigned to (i) sibutramine alone; (ii) lifestyle modification alone; (iii) sibutramine plus lifestyle modification (i.e., combined therapy); or (iv) sibutramine plus brief therapy. Participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) at baseline and weeks 6, 10, 18, 26, 40, and 52. At 1 year, participants in combined therapy lost the most weight and those in sibutramine alone the least (12.1 +/- 8.8% vs. 5.5 +/- 6.5%; P &lt; 0.01). Mean BDI-II scores across all participants declined from 8.1 +/- 6.9 to 6.2 +/- 7.7 at 1 year (P &lt; 0.001), with no significant differences among groups. Despite this favorable change, 13.9% of participants (across the four groups) reported potentially discernible increases (&gt;or= 5 points on the BDI-II) in symptoms of depression at week 52. They lost significantly less weight than participants in the rest of the sample (5.4 +/- 7.8% vs. 9.0 +/- 7.8%, respectively; P &lt; 0.03). The baseline prevalence of suicidal ideation was 3.6%. Seven new cases of suicidal ideation were observed during the year, with three in lifestyle modification alone. Further research is needed to identify characteristics of obese patients at risk of negative mood changes (and suicidal ideation) in response to behavioral and pharmacologic therapies.</fragment>

		<summary>This article documents the outcomes of an Internet-based self-care pain management intervention that focused on mind-body exercises.

		<content>
			<section label="UNLABELLED">
				<fragment>The Self-care Pain Management Project assessed the feasibility and efficacy of delivering online mind-body self-care techniques to 78 adults aged 55 and older with chronic pain. To assess feasibility, the study monitored use of the intervention and documented participant satisfaction. A randomized trial with intervention (n = 41) and waiting list comparison groups (n = 37) was used to assess changes in pain intensity, limitations due to pain, pain self-efficacy, depression, anxiety, and awareness of responses to pain from baseline to follow-up at 6 weeks. There were statistically significant results for between-group difference in awareness of responses to pain, improvements in pain intensity and pain interference for both groups, and increases in confidence with using nonmedical self-care techniques to manage pain for the intervention group. Reductions in mean pain scores reported by the intervention group at log on and log off also suggest that the intervention may have an immediate impact on reducing pain. Findings document the feasibility of a relatively short-term, online mind-body pain management intervention that can have benefits for participants. The characteristics of those who volunteered for an online self-care pain management intervention also have implications for identifying target populations for such interventions.</fragment>

				<fragment>Chronic pain is a common, disabling problem in older adults. Pain self-management training is a multimodal therapy that has been found to be effective in young to middle-aged adult samples; however, few studies have examined the effectiveness of this therapy in older adults. In this randomized, controlled trial, we evaluated a pain self-management training group (SMG) intervention as compared with an education-only (BOOK) control condition. Participants, 65 years of age or older who experienced persistent, noncancer pain that limited their activities, were recruited from 43 retirement communities in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The primary outcome was physical disability, as measured by the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were depression (Geriatric Depression Scale), pain intensity (Brief Pain Inventory), and pain-related interference with activities (Brief Pain Inventory). Randomization occurred by facility to minimize cross-contamination between groups. Two-hundred and fifty-six individuals, mean age=81.8 (SD: 6.5), enrolled and 218 completed the study. No significant differences in outcomes were found between groups at post-intervention, 6-month follow-up, or 12-month follow-up. The SMG group showed a significantly greater increase over time, relative to the BOOK group, in two process measures, as measured by the Chronic Pain Coping Inventory: use of relaxation and use of exercise/stretching. In both cases, the increase was greatest from baseline to the post-intervention assessment. Study findings indicate that additional research is needed to determine the most effective content and delivery methods for self-management therapies targeted at older adults with chronic pain.</fragment>
