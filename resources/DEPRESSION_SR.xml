		<summary>CBT for depression in older people is more effective than waiting list or TAU, but greater efficacy than active controls or other treatment has not been demonstrated. More high-quality RCTs comparing CBT with active controls need to be conducted before firm conclusions can be drawn about the efficacy of CBT for depression in older people.

				<fragment>Four hundred eighty-five studies were identified, of which 23 were included. At the end of the intervention, CBT was significantly more effective at reducing depressive symptoms (irrespective of whether rated by clinicians or participants) than treatment as usual (TAU) or being on a waiting list but not than active controls. The same pattern of results was found for 6-month follow-up. At all other time-points, pooled effect sizes in favor of CBT were nonsignificant. Clinician-rated outcome measures resulted in larger effect sizes in favor of CBT than self-rated measures. No significant differences in efficacy were found between CBT and other treatment (pharmacotherapy and other psychotherapies). Meta-regression analyses revealed four factors that predicted effect sizes for comparisons between CBT and control conditions, including whether concurrent pharmacotherapy was allowed.</fragment>

		<updated>2012-05-30</updated>
		<summary>Although any definition of 'brief' is likely to be somewhat arbitrary, an inclusion threshold of 6 hours contact per patient was used to select brief high-intensity intervention studies. Most excluded studies evaluated clearly resource-intensive interventions, though occasionally, studies were excluded on the basis of having only slightly more than 6 hours contact per patient.There is inadequate evidence to determine the clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of low-intensity interventions for the prevention of relapse or recurrence of depression. A scoping review of brief high-intensity therapies indicates that some approaches have shown promise in some studies, but findings have not been consistent. Many uncertainties remain and further primary research is required. Careful consideration should be given to the scope of such research; it is important to evaluate the broader patient pathway accounting for the heterogeneous patient groups of interest. Future RCTs conducted in a UK primary care setting should include adult participants in remission or recovery from depression, and evaluate the quality of the intervention and consistency of delivery across practitioners where appropriate. The occurrence of relapse or recurrence should be measured using established methods, and functional outcomes as well as symptoms should be measured; data on quality of life using a generic instrument, such as the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), should be collected.</summary>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Depression is the most common mental disorder in community settings and a major cause of disability across the world. The objective of treatment is to achieve remission or at least adequate control of depressive symptoms; however, even after successful treatment, the risk of relapse after remission is significant. Although the effectiveness of low-intensity interventions has been extensively evaluated to treat primary symptoms of psychological difficulties, there has been substantially less research examining the use of these interventions as a relapse prevention strategy.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>To systematically review the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of low-intensity psychological or psychosocial interventions to prevent relapse or recurrence in patients with depression. As the broader definition of 'low-intensity' psychological intervention is somewhat contested, the review was conducted in two parts: A, a systematic review of all evaluations of 'low-intensity' interventions that were delivered by para-professionals, peer supporters or psychological well-being practitioners as defined by the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme; and B, a scoping review of relevant evaluations of interventions involving qualified mental health professionals (e.g. psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, cognitive behavioural therapists) involving &lt; 6 hours of contact per patient.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="DATA SOURCES" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Comprehensive literature searches were developed; electronic databases were searched from inception until September 2010 (including MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, PsycINFO, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library), internet resources were used to identify guidelines on the treatment of depression, and the bibliographies of relevant reviews, guidelines and included studies were scrutinised.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="REVIEW METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts; data were extracted independently by one reviewer using a standardised data extraction form and checked by another. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus, with involvement of a third reviewer when necessary. The inclusion criteria were population - adults or adolescents who had received treatment for depression; intervention - part A, low-intensity interventions, specifically any unsupported psychological/psychosocial interventions or any supported interventions that did not involve highly qualified mental health professionals, and, part B, interventions carried out by qualified mental health professionals that involved &lt; 6 hours of contact per patient; comparator - any, including no treatment, placebo, psychological or pharmacological interventions; outcomes - relapse or recurrence, other outcomes (e.g. social function, quality of life) were recorded where reported; and study design - for clinical effectiveness, randomised, quasi-randomised and non-randomised studies with concurrent control patients. For cost-effectiveness, full economic evaluations that compared two or more treatment options and considered both costs and consequences. No studies met the main part A inclusion criteria.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>For the clinical effectiveness review, 17 studies (14 completed, three ongoing), reported in 27 publications, met the part B inclusion criteria. These studies were clinically and methodologically diverse, and reported differing degrees of efficacy for the evaluated interventions. One randomised controlled trial (RCT), which evaluated a collaborative care-type programme, was potentially relevant to part A; this study reported no difference between patients receiving the intervention and those receiving usual care in terms of relapse of depression over 12 months. For the cost-effectiveness review, two studies met the criteria for part B. One of these was an economic evaluation of the RCT above, which was potentially relevant to part A. This evaluation found that the intervention may be a cost-effective use of resources when compared with usual care; however, it was unclear how valid these estimates were for the NHS.</fragment>

		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Physical inactivity and comorbid depressive symptoms are prevalent among patients with a chronic illness. To our knowledge, randomized controlled trials of the effects of exercise training on depressive symptoms among patients with a chronic illness have not been systematically reviewed. We estimated the population effect of exercise training on depressive symptoms and determined whether the effect varied according to patient characteristics and modifiable features of exercise exposure and clinical settings.</fragment>

			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Articles published before June 1, 2011, were located using the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans Scientific Database, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science. Ninety articles involving 10,534 sedentary patients with a chronic illness were selected. Included articles required (1) randomized allocation to an exercise intervention or nonexercise comparison condition and (2) a depression outcome assessed at baseline and at mid- and/or postintervention. Hedges d effect sizes were computed, study quality was evaluated, and random effects models were used to estimate sampling error and population variance of the observed effects.</fragment>

		<summary>Hispanic cancer patients in the USA, but not other ethnic minority groups, report significantly worse distress, depression, social HRQoL, and overall HRQoL than do majority patients, of which all but depression might be clinically important. Heterogeneous results might, however, have limited the interpretation. Data for other minority groups and for anxiety are scarce. More studies are needed from outside the USA. Future reports should more clearly describe their minority group samples and analyses should control for clinical and sociodemographic variables known to predict outcomes. Understanding of why outcomes are poor in US Hispanic patients is needed to inform the targeting of interventions.</summary>

We excluded African Americans and indigenous groups. Eligible articles were rated for quality of reporting, external validity, internal validity, sample size, and power. Each quality criterion was rated independently by two reviewers until inter-rater reliability was achieved. In a meta-analysis we compared mean scores adjusted for socioeconomic status and other sociodemographic and clinical variables, where available. Effect sizes greater than 0Â·5 and 95% CI that included 0Â·5 or -0Â·5 were deemed clinically important, with negative values indicating worse outcomes in minority patients. We assessed publication bias by estimating the number of potential unpublished studies and the number of non-signficant studies with p=0Â·05 required to produce a non-significant overall result.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>We identified 21 eligible articles that included 18 datasets collected in the USA and one in each of Canada, Romania, and the UK. Ethnic minority groups were Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, or Hungarian (one dataset). Overall, we found minority versus majority groups to have significantly worse distress (mean difference -0Â·37, 95% CI -0Â·46 to -0Â·28; p&lt;0Â·0001), depression (-0Â·23, -0Â·36 to -0Â·11; p=0Â·0003), and overall HRQoL (-0Â·33, -0Â·58 to -0Â·07; p=0Â·013). Further analyses found disparities to be specific to Hispanic patients in the USA, in whom poorer outcomes were consistent with potentially clinically important differences for distress (effect size -0Â·37, 95% CI -0Â·54 to -0Â·20; p&lt;0Â·0001), social HRQoL (-0Â·45, -0Â·87 to -0Â·03; p=0Â·035), and overall HRQoL (-0Â·49, -0Â·78 to -0.20; p=0Â·0008). Results were significantly heterogeneous for overall HRQoL and all domains. Tests for interaction, for adjusted versus unadjusted and comparisons of high-quality, medium-quality, and low-quality articles, were generally non-significant, which suggests no bias. We found no evidence of any substantive publication bias.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="INTERPRETATION" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>Hispanic cancer patients in the USA, but not other ethnic minority groups, report significantly worse distress, depression, social HRQoL, and overall HRQoL than do majority patients, of which all but depression might be clinically important. Heterogeneous results might, however, have limited the interpretation. Data for other minority groups and for anxiety are scarce. More studies are needed from outside the USA. Future reports should more clearly describe their minority group samples and analyses should control for clinical and sociodemographic variables known to predict outcomes. Understanding of why outcomes are poor in US Hispanic patients is needed to inform the targeting of interventions.</fragment>

		<summary>The mindfulness-based interventions are efficacious for alleviating depressive symptoms in adults with mental disorders. The interventions could be used in conjunction with other treatments in clinical settings.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="OBJECTIVES" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Depression, a common mental health problem, is projected to be the second leading cause of disability for adults by year 2020. Mindfulness-based interventions (MFIs) have been integrated into therapeutic work on depression, but limited systematic reviews reported their efficacy on heterogeneous groups of mental disorders. This meta-analysis aimed to examine the efficacy of the MFIs on depressive symptoms in people with various mental disorders.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="DESIGN" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A meta-analysis of experimental and quasi-experimental studies was undertaken.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="DATA SOURCES" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Multiple search strategies were undertaken to identify published and unpublished studies conducted between 1995 and 2011. Electronic databases used were Scopus, CINAHL, PubMed, ScienceDirect, PsyINFO, Dissertation Abstract International, Web of Science Index, Controlled-trial.com, and clinicaltrails.gov.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="REVIEW METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Data were extracted and appraised by two reviewers. For each study, the Quality Rating Index (QRI) and Code Sheet for Randomized Controlled Trials (CS-RCT) were used to assess methodological quality and extract relevant data respectively. Data were analysed and synthesized using PASW statistic 17.0 and Comprehensive Meta Analyses Software 2.0.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Thirty-nine studies conducted in ten countries were included and 105 effect sizes were calculated. Most studies utilised single group pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design, convenience sampling, and self-reported questionnaires. Between-group comparisons indicated that MFIs are superior to standard care in reducing depressive symptoms and preventing relapse with effect sizes ranging from 0.11 to 1.65. Exposure-based cognitive therapy (d=2.09) appeared to be the most efficacious intervention, followed by mindfulness-based stress reduction programme (d=1.92), acceptance-based behaviour therapy (d=1.33), and stress less with mindfulness (d=1.31). Effect sizes were significantly associated with the length of intervention sessions but not related to methodological quality of studies.</fragment>

		<summary>On average, obese individuals in weight loss trials experienced reductions in symptoms of depression. Future studies should examine incidence and resolution of clinically significant depressive disorders with weight loss interventions.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Obesity is related to increased risk of several health complications, including depression. Many studies have reported improvements in mood with weight loss, but results have been equivocal. The present meta-analysis examined changes in symptoms of depression that were reported in trials of weight loss interventions. Between-groups comparisons of different weight loss methods (for example, lifestyle modification, diet-alone and pharmacotherapy) were examined, as were within-group changes for each treatment type.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHOD" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>MEDLINE was searched for articles published between 1950 and January 2009. Several obesity-related terms were intersected with terms related to depression. Results were filtered to return only studies of human subjects, published in English. Of 5971 articles, 394 were randomized controlled trials. Articles were excluded if they did not report mean changes in weight or symptoms of depression, included children or persons with psychiatric disorders (other than depression), or provided insufficient data for analysis. Thirty-one studies (n=7937) were included. Two authors independently extracted a description of each study treatment, sample characteristics, assessment methods and changes in weight and symptoms of depression. Treatments were categorized as lifestyle modification, non-dieting, dietary counseling, diet-alone, exercise-alone, pharmacotherapy, placebo or control interventions.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Random effects models found that lifestyle modification was superior to control and non-dieting interventions for reducing symptoms of depression, and marginally better than dietary counseling and exercise-alone programs. Exercise-alone programs were superior to controls. No differences were found for comparisons of pharmacologic agents and placebos. Within-group analyses found significant reductions in symptoms of depression for nearly all active interventions. A meta-regression found no relationship between changes in weight and changes in symptoms of depression in lifestyle modification interventions.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>About 30-50% of complex dizziness disorders are organically not sufficiently explained or related to a psychiatric disorder. Of patients with such dizziness disorders, 80% are severely impaired by dizziness in their daily and working lives; nevertheless, they are often not diagnosed or treated adequately.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="OBJECTIVES" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>This review aims to give a systematic overview of psychotherapeutic approaches and their efficacy regarding the treatment of dizziness that is medically not sufficiently explained or related to a psychiatric disorder.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A systematic literature search was conducted in Medline, PSYNDEX and PsycINFO. Included in this systematic review were (randomised) controlled trials ((R)CTs) concerning psychotherapy in patients with dizziness, medically not sufficiently explained or associated with a psychiatric disorder. If possible, Hedges' g was used to express the effect sizes (ES) of the treatment. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q statistic. In addition, the quality of the studies was rated.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Three (R)CTs were included. All studies used cognitive-behavioural treatment methods in combination with relaxation techniques or vestibular rehabilitation. All studies suggested that psychotherapy may provide improvement. The mean ES in the treatment groups was 0.46 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.88) for dizziness related outcome, 0.10 (-0.44 to 0.64) for anxiety and 0.17 (-0.24 to 0.58) for depression whereas in the control groups the mean dizziness related ES was -0.04 (-0.44 to 0.37), anxiety related ES was -0.03 (-0.43 to 0.38) and depression related ES was -0.02 (-0.42 to 0.38). The quality of the studies was average. Sample sizes were small, however, and there was a lack of long term studies.</fragment>

		<summary>Depression after stroke is an important problem with adverse effects on the patient's ability to participate in rehabilitation and on rehabilitation outcome. The interventions described can be implemented in nursing care of patients with poststroke depression. The variety of such interventions and the diversity of their nature and design are consistent with the practice of rehabilitation nursing.â The findings of this review enable nurses to intervene effectively to reduce the occurrence and severity of depression in patients with stroke.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="AIMS AND OBJECTIVES" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>This systematic review explores the nursing role in the management of poststroke depression and identifies effective non-pharmacological interventions that nurses can use in the daily care of patients with stroke.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Depression is a common complication poststroke and affects one-third of patients with stroke. It has a negative impact on functional recovery and social activities and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Detection and diagnosis of poststroke depression is inconsistent, and many depressed patients are under-treated. Although nurses recognise that observation and assessment are parts of their role in rehabilitation care, little is known about their role in assessing depression or the interventions they can use.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="DESIGN" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A systematic review was conducted using the Cochrane method.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Literature for the period 1993-2008 was searched in the electronic databases of CINAHL, Medline (PubMed), Nursing Journals (PubMed) and PsycINFO using the following keywords: cerebrovascular accident, stroke, depression, poststroke depression, treatment, therapy, treatment outcome, management.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Fifteen articles and one systematic review were identified. There was strong evidence that information provision reduces the severity of depression. Other interventions with positive effects on the occurrence or severity of poststroke depression were as follows: life review therapy, motivational interviewing, a specific nursing support programme and physical exercise.</fragment>

Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to define the concept areas of sexual abuse and psychiatric disorders and was limited to epidemiological studies. Six independent reviewers extracted descriptive, quality, and outcome data from eligible longitudinal studies.

The unadjusted weighted prevalence rate reported across all surveys for PTSD was 30.6% (95% CI, 26.3%-35.2%) and for depression was 30.8% (95% CI, 26.3%-35.6%). Methodological factors accounted for 12.9% and 27.7% PTSD and depression, respectively. Nonrandom sampling, small sample sizes, and self-report questionnaires were associated with higher rates of mental disorder. Adjusting for methodological factors, reported torture (Delta total R(2) between base methodological model and base model + substantive factor [DeltaR(2)] = 23.6%; OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.52-2.65) emerged as the strongest factor associated with PTSD, followed by cumulative exposure to PTEs (DeltaR(2) = 10.8%; OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.21-1.91), time since conflict (DeltaR(2) = 10%; OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66-0.91), and assessed level of political terror (DeltaR(2) = 3.5%; OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.03-2.50). For depression, significant factors were number of PTEs (DeltaR(2) = 22.0%; OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.39-1.93), time since conflict (DeltaR(2) = 21.9%; OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.69-0.93), reported torture (DeltaR(2) = 11.4%; OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.07-2.04), and residency status (DeltaR(2) = 5.0%; OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.07-1.57).</fragment>

				<fragment>Methodological factors and substantive population risk factors, such as exposure to torture and other PTEs, after adjusting for methodological factors account for higher rates of reported prevalence of PTSD and depression.</fragment>

		<summary>Randomized placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant medications during pregnancy are ethically justified. Well-conducted and ethically justified trials of antidepressants should improve the quality of care provided to depressed pregnant women and thus address a major public health problem.</summary>

			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>To determine whether placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials of antidepressant medications with pregnant participants are ethically justified.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="DATA SOURCES" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We searched PUBMED, PsychINFO, and Cochrane databases for articles related to the ethical justification of randomized placebo-controlled trials involving pregnant women and for all research articles for the treatment of depression during pregnancy, using the keys words depression, antidepressive agents, pregnancy, clinical trials, placebo, and ethics. We based our ethical framework on current literature on the ethics of maternal-fetal medicine and research and the requirements of argument-based ethics.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We selected studies in which maternal, fetal, and neonatal health outcomes associated with antidepressant exposure were reported.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>We integrated evidence-based reasoning and argument-based ethics to address four questions to determine whether what is known as normative equipoise (evidence-based reasoning requires uncertainty about which clinical management is superior) exists: 1) Is there evidence of efficacy of antidepressant use during pregnancy? 2) Is there documented causality of serious, far-reaching, and irreversible clinical harm to the fetal or neonatal patient? 3) Is there documented causality of serious, far-reaching, and irreversible harm to depressed pregnant women in a placebo arm? 4) Are there no or only rare documented occurrences of less serious injury to the fetal or neonatal patient? Evidence-based answers to these questions support the judgment that normative equipoise exists with respect to randomized placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants with pregnant participants.</fragment>

				<fragment>Depression is associated with poor adherence to self-care regimen in individuals with diabetes.

				<fragment>Cochrane library, Pubmed, MEDLINE, EBM review, ProQuest Medical Bundle and SCOPUS databases were searched using the following medical subject headings or key words - depression, mood disorder, depressive symptoms, diabetes mellitus, glycaemic control, glycated haemoglobin, glucose, psychological therapy, psychotherapy, non-pharmacological therapy and cognitive behaviour therapy. The publication date was limited from 1996-2007. Studies were selected if they used a randomised controlled trial design, were written in English, used non-pharmacological treatments for treating depression, included individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus as participants and included depressive symptoms and glycaemic control (determined by haemoglobin A(1)C) as outcomes.</fragment>

		<summary>Despite previous research suggesting that MT may be an effective treatment for depression, there is currently a lack of evidence to support this assertion from RCTs that have selected participants for depression or SSD.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>People with depressive disorders or subsyndromal symptoms of depression (SSD) often use complementary and alternative therapies, including massage therapy (MT). This systematic review evaluates the evidence, from randomised clinical trials (RCTs), for the effectiveness of multiple sessions of classical European (Swedish) MT for the treatment of depression.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Eligible RCTs were identified via eight electronic databases and manual searches of references. Two reviewers independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Four RCTs met our inclusion criteria. Three of these RCTs compared MT with relaxation therapies, but provided insufficient data and analyses to contribute meaningfully to the evaluation of MT for depression. The fourth included RCT used MT as a control condition to evaluate a depression-specific acupuncture treatment. This trial provided limited evidence that, in the early stages of treatment, MT is less effective than acupuncture for treating depression, a treatment which itself is not accepted for this condition.</fragment>

			<section label="CONCLUSIONS" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>Despite previous research suggesting that MT may be an effective treatment for depression, there is currently a lack of evidence to support this assertion from RCTs that have selected participants for depression or SSD.</fragment>
