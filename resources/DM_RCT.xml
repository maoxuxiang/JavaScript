		<summary>Compared with lower-dose statin therapy, atorvastatin 80 mg/day did not increase the incidence of NOD in patients with 0 to 1 NOD risk factors but did, by 24%, among patients with 2 to 4 NOD risk factors.

		<summary>Long-term fenofibrate treatment could increase serum FGF21 levels over 5 yr in patients with type 2 diabetes. Additional studies are needed to investigate the potential role of FGF21 in the fenofibrate-mediated reduction of cardiovascular risk.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="CONTEXT" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Fenofibrate is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α agonist that showed beneficial effects on total cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes in the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>This study aimed to investigate the long-term effect of fenofibrate therapy on three novel biomarkers of cardiovascular risk, namely adipocyte-fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP), fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), and retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), which are all downstream targets of PPAR-α or PPAR-γ, in patients with type 2 diabetes.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A total of 216 patients (108 in the fenofibrate group and 108 in the placebo group) were randomly selected from the FIELD study cohort. A-FABP, FGF21, and RBP4 levels were measured in serum samples at both baseline and the fifth year of the study.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Relative to the placebo group, the changes of serum FGF21 and RBP4 levels were 85% (P &lt; 0.001) and 10% (P = 0.032) higher in the fenofibrate group, respectively, over 5 yr. Fenofibrate treatment had no detectable effect on serum A-FABP level (P &gt; 0.05). The effect of fenofibrate treatment on serum FGF21, but not RBP4, remained significant after adjusting for fenofibrate-induced changes in glycosylated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein A-II, fibrinogen, plasma creatinine, and homocysteine (P = 0.002).</fragment>

			<section label="CONCLUSIONS" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>Long-term fenofibrate treatment could increase serum FGF21 levels over 5 yr in patients with type 2 diabetes. Additional studies are needed to investigate the potential role of FGF21 in the fenofibrate-mediated reduction of cardiovascular risk.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists exenatide and liraglutide have been shown to improve glycaemic control and reduce bodyweight in patients with type 2 diabetes. We compared the efficacy and safety of exenatide once weekly with liraglutide once daily in patients with type 2 diabetes.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We did a 26 week, open-label, randomised, parallel-group study at 105 sites in 19 countries between Jan 11, 2010, and Jan 17, 2011. Patients aged 18 years or older with type 2 diabetes treated with lifestyle modification and oral antihyperglycaemic drugs were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated randomisation sequence with a voice response system, to receive injections of once-daily liraglutide (1·8 mg) or once-weekly exenatide (2 mg). Participants and investigators were not masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) from baseline to week 26. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01029886.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Of 912 randomised patients, 911 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (450 liraglutide, 461 exenatide). The least-squares mean change in HbA(1c) was greater in patients in the liraglutide group (-1·48%, SE 0·05; n=386) than in those in the exenatide group (-1·28%, 0·05; 390) with the treatment difference (0·21%, 95% CI 0·08-0·33) not meeting predefined non-inferiority criteria (upper limit of CI &lt;0·25%). The most common adverse events were nausea (93 [21%] in the liraglutide group vs 43 [9%] in the exenatide group), diarrhoea (59 [13%] vs 28 [6%]), and vomiting 48 [11%] vs 17 [4%]), which occurred less frequently in the exenatide group and with decreasing incidence over time in both groups. 24 (5%) patients allocated to liraglutide and 12 (3%) allocated to exenatide discontinued participation because of adverse events.</fragment>

				<fragment>Mindful eating offers promise as an effective approach for weight management and glycemic control in people with diabetes. Diabetes self-management education (DSME) is an essential component of effective self-care. Yet, little research has compared the effect of mindful eating to DSME-based treatment. This study compared the impact of these two interventions in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A prospective randomized controlled trial with two parallel interventions was used. Participants included adults age 35 to 65 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 1 year or more, body mass index (BMI) of 27 or more, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 7% or more who were randomly assigned to a 3-month mindful eating (MB-EAT-D; n=27) or Smart Choices (SC) DSME-based (n=25) intervention. Follow-up occurred 3 months after intervention completion. Dietary intake, physical activity, weight, HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose, and fasting insulin were assessed using repeated measures analysis of variance with contrast analysis. There was no significant difference between groups in the change in weight or glycemia at study end. Significant difference occurred between groups in the change in dietary intake/1,000 kcal of trans fats, total fiber, and sugars (all P&lt;0.05). Mean (± standard error) reduction in weight (-2.92 ± 0.54 kg for SC vs -1.53 ± 0.54 kg for MB-EAT-D) and HbA1c (-0.67 ± 0.24% for SC and -0.83 ± 0.24% for MB-EAT-D) were significant (P&lt;0.01). Significant reduction in energy intake and glycemic load occurred (all P&lt;0.0001) for both groups. Training in mindful eating and diabetes self-management facilitate improvement in dietary intake, modest weight loss, and glycemic control. The availability of effective treatments gives patients with diabetes choices in meeting their self-care needs.</fragment>

				<fragment>The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes poses a major public health challenge. Population-based screening and early treatment for type 2 diabetes could reduce this growing burden. However, uncertainty persists around the benefits of screening for type 2 diabetes. We assessed the effect of a population-based stepwise screening programme on mortality.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In a pragmatic parallel group, cluster-randomised trial, 33 general practices in eastern England were randomly assigned by the method of minimisation in an unbalanced design to: screening followed by intensive multifactorial treatment for people diagnosed with diabetes (n=15); screening plus routine care of diabetes according to national guidelines (n=13); and a no-screening control group (n=5). The study population consisted of 20,184 individuals aged 40-69 years (mean 58 years), at high risk of prevalent undiagnosed diabetes, on the basis of a previously validated risk score. In screening practices, individuals were invited to a stepwise programme including random capillary blood glucose and glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) tests, a fasting capillary blood glucose test, and a confirmatory oral glucose tolerance test. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. All participants were flagged for mortality surveillance by the England and Wales Office of National Statistics. Analysis was by intention-to-screen and compared all-cause mortality rates between screening and control groups. This study is registered, number ISRCTN86769081.</fragment>

				<fragment>Patients were assessed before and 1 and 3 months after CPAP started. Tests for repeated measures were used to compare variables of interest over time. Results: Forty-four patients (75%) completed the study. Their mean ± sd age was 66.1 ± 8.8 yr, and 61.4% were male. Completers and noncompleters had similar age, sex, diabetes duration, apnea-hypopnea index, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (P ≥ 0.29). There were no differences in outcome between early and late randomization, and the data were pooled. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale decreased between entry and 1 month [-4.8 (-6.5 to -3.1), P &lt; 0.001]. Blood pressure improved between entry and 3 months (from 149 ± 23/80 ± 12 to 140 ± 18/73 ± 13 mm Hg; P ≤ 0.007). Pulse rate declined within the first month [-6 (-10 to -2) beats/min, P = 0.002]. Glycemic control and serum lipids, which were mostly within recommended target ranges at entry, did not change.</fragment>

				<fragment>Micro- or macroalbuminuria is associated with increased cardiovascular risk factors among patients with type 2 diabetes, but whether albuminuria within the normal range predicts long-term cardiovascular risk is unknown. We evaluated the relationships between albuminuria and cardiovascular events in 1208 hypertensive, normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes from the BErgamo NEphrologic Diabetes Complication Trial (BENEDICT), all of whom received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) therapy at the end of the trial and were followed for a median of 9.2 years. The main outcome was time to the first of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction; stroke; coronary, carotid, or peripheral artery revascularization; or hospitalization for heart failure. Overall, 189 (15.6%) of the patients experienced a main outcome event (2.14 events/100 patient-years); 24 events were fatal. Albuminuria independently predicted events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.08). Second-degree polynomial multivariable analysis showed a continuous nonlinear relationship between albuminuria and events without thresholds. Considering the entire study population, even albuminuria at 1-2 μg/min was significantly associated with increased risk compared with albuminuria &lt;1 μg/min (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.07). This relationship was similar in the subgroup originally randomly assigned to non-ACEI therapy. Among those originally receiving ACEI therapy, however, the event rate was uniformly low and was not significantly associated with albuminuria. Taken together, among normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes, any degree of measurable albuminuria bears significant cardiovascular risk. The association with risk is continuous but is lost with early ACEI therapy.</fragment>

		<summary>In the JUPITER primary prevention trial, the cardiovascular and mortality benefits of statin therapy exceed the diabetes hazard, including in participants at high risk of developing diabetes.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>In view of evidence that statin therapy increases risk of diabetes, the balance of benefit and risk of these drugs in primary prevention has become controversial. We undertook an analysis of participants from the JUPITER trial to address the balance of vascular benefits and diabetes hazard of statin use.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In the randomised, double-blind JUPITER trial, 17,603 men and women without previous cardiovascular disease or diabetes were randomly assigned to rosuvastatin 20 mg or placebo and followed up for up to 5 years for the primary endpoint (myocardial infarction, stroke, admission to hospital for unstable angina, arterial revascularisation, or cardiovascular death) and the protocol-prespecified secondary endpoints of venous thromboembolism, all-cause mortality, and incident physician-reported diabetes. In this analysis, participants were stratified on the basis of having none or at least one of four major risk factors for developing diabetes: metabolic syndrome, impaired fasting glucose, body-mass index 30 kg/m(2) or higher, or glycated haemoglobin A(1c) greater than 6%. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00239681.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Trial participants with one or more major diabetes risk factor (n=11,508) were at higher risk of developing diabetes than were those without a major risk factor (n=6095). In individuals with one or more risk factors, statin allocation was associated with a 39% reduction in the primary endpoint (hazard ratio [HR] 0·61, 95% CI 0·47-0·79, p=0·0001), a 36% reduction in venous thromboembolism (0·64, 0·39-1·06, p=0·08), a 17% reduction in total mortality (0·83, 0·64-1·07, p=0·15), and a 28% increase in diabetes (1·28, 1·07-1·54, p=0·01). Thus, for those with diabetes risk factors, a total of 134 vascular events or deaths were avoided for every 54 new cases of diabetes diagnosed. For trial participants with no major diabetes risk factors, statin allocation was associated with a 52% reduction in the primary endpoint (HR 0·48, 95% CI 0·33-0·68, p=0·0001), a 53% reduction in venous thromboembolism (0·47, 0·21-1·03, p=0·05), a 22% reduction in total mortality (0·78, 0·59-1·03, p=0·08), and no increase in diabetes (0·99, 0·45-2·21, p=0·99). For such individuals, a total of 86 vascular events or deaths were avoided with no new cases of diabetes diagnosed. In analysis limited to the 486 participants who developed diabetes during follow-up (270 on rosuvastatin vs 216 on placebo; HR 1·25, 95% CI 1·05-1·49, p=0·01), the point estimate of cardiovascular risk reduction associated with statin therapy (HR 0·63, 95% CI 0·25-1·60) was consistent with that for the trial as a whole (0·56, 0·46-0·69). By comparison with placebo, statins accelerated the average time to diagnosis of diabetes by 5·4 weeks (84·3 [SD 47·8] weeks on rosuvastatin vs 89·7 [50·4] weeks on placebo).</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Addition of a sulphonylurea to metformin improves glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes, but is associated with hypoglycaemia and weight gain. We aimed to compare a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (linagliptin) against a commonly used sulphonylurea (glimepiride).</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In this 2-year, parallel-group, non-inferiority double-blind trial, outpatients with type 2 diabetes and glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) 6·5-10·0% on stable metformin alone or with one additional oral antidiabetic drug (washed out during screening) were randomly assigned (1:1) by computer-generated random sequence via a voice or web response system to linagliptin (5 mg) or glimepiride (1-4 mg) orally once daily. Study investigators and participants were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was change in HbA(1c) from baseline to week 104. Analyses included all patients randomly assigned to treatment groups who received at least one dose of treatment, had a baseline HbA(1c) measurement, and had at least one on-treatment HbA(1c) measurement. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00622284.</fragment>

			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>777 patients were randomly assigned to linagliptin and 775 to glimepiride; 764 and 755 were included in analysis of the primary endpoint. Reductions in adjusted mean HbA(1c) (baseline 7·69% [SE 0·03] in both groups) were similar in the linagliptin (-0·16% [SE 0·03]) and glimepiride groups (-0·36% [0·03]; difference 0·20%, 97·5% CI 0·09-0·30), meeting the predefined non-inferiority criterion of 0·35%. Fewer participants had hypoglycaemia (58 [7%] of 776 vs 280 [36%] of 775 patients, p&lt;0·0001) or severe hypoglycaemia (1 [&lt;1%] vs 12 [2%]) with linagliptin compared with glimepiride. Linagliptin was associated with significantly fewer cardiovascular events (12 vs 26 patients; relative risk 0·46, 95% CI 0·23-0·91, p=0·0213).</fragment>

		<summary>These effects are consistent with a potent and rapid antiinflammatory effect of sitagliptin and may potentially contribute to the inhibition of atherosclerosis. The suppression of CD26 expression suggests that sitagliptin may inhibit the synthesis of DPP-IV in addition to inhibiting its action.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="CONTEXT" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Sitagliptin is an inhibitor of the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV), which degrades the incretins, glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, and thus, sitagliptin increases their bioavailability. The stimulation of insulin and the suppression of glucagon secretion that follow exert a glucose lowering effect and hence its use as an antidiabetic drug. Because DPP-IV is expressed as CD26 on cell membranes and because CD26 mediates proinflammatory signals, we hypothesized that sitagliptin may exert an antiinflammatory effect.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="PATIENTS AND METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Twenty-two patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive either 100 mg daily of sitagliptin or placebo for 12 wk. Fasting blood samples were obtained at baseline and at 2, 4, and 6 hours after a single dose of sitagliptin and at 2, 4, 8, and 12 wk of treatment.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Glycosylated hemoglobin fell significantly from 7.6 ± 0.4 to 6.9 ± 3% in patients treated with sitagliptin. Fasting glucagon-like peptide-1 concentrations increased significantly, whereas the mRNA expression in mononuclear cell of CD26, the proinflammatory cytokine, TNFα, the receptor for endotoxin, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4, TLR-2, and proinflammatory kinases, c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 and inhibitory-κB kinase (IKKβ), and that of the chemokine receptor CCR-2 fell significantly after 12 wk of sitagliptin. TLR-2, IKKβ, CCR-2, and CD26 expression and nuclear factor-κB binding also fell after a single dose of sitagliptin. There was a fall in protein expression of c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1, IKKβ, and TLR-4 and in plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein, IL-6, and free fatty acids after 12 wk of sitagliptin.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Glycaemic control deteriorates progressively over time in patients with type 2 diabetes. Options for treatment escalation remain controversial after failure of first-line treatment with metformin. We compared add-on exenatide with glimepiride for durability of glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin alone.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We did an open-label, randomised controlled trial at 128 centres in 14 countries between Sept 5, 2006, and March 29, 2011. Patients aged 18-85 years with type 2 diabetes inadequately treated by metformin were randomly assigned via a computer-generated randomisation sequence to receive exenatide twice daily or glimepiride once daily as add-on to metformin. Randomisation was stratified by predetermined categories of glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1C)) concentration. The primary outcome was time to inadequate glycaemic control and need for alternative treatment, defined as an HbA(1c) concentration of more than 9% after the first 3 months of treatment, or more than 7% at two consecutive visits after the first 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2005-005448-21, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00359762.</fragment>

				<fragment>We randomly assigned 515 patients to the exenatide group and 514 to the glimepiride group, of whom 490 versus 487 were the intention-to-treat population. 203 (41%) patients had treatment failure in the exenatide group compared with 262 (54%) in the glimepiride group (risk difference 12·4 [95% CI 6·2-18·6], hazard ratio 0·748 [0·623-0·899]; p=0·002). 218 (44%) of 490 patients in the exenatide group, and 150 (31%) of 487 in the glimepiride group achieved an HbA(1c) concentration of less than 7% (p&lt;0·0001), and 140 (29%) versus 87 (18%) achieved concentrations of 6·5% and less (p=0·0001). We noted a significantly greater decrease in bodyweight in patients given exenatide than in those given glimepiride (p&lt;0·0001). Five patients in each treatment group died from causes unrelated to treatment. Significantly fewer patients in the exenatide group than in the glimepiride group reported documented symptomatic (p&lt;0·0001), nocturnal (p=0·007), and non-nocturnal (p&lt;0·0001) hypoglycaemia. Discontinuation because of adverse events (mainly gastrointestinal) was significantly higher (p=0·0005) in the exenatide group than in the glimepiride group in the first 6 months of treatment, but not thereafter.</fragment>

		<summary>We conclude that prediabetes is a high-risk state for diabetes, especially in patients who remain with prediabetes despite intensive lifestyle intervention. Reversion to normal glucose regulation, even if transient, is associated with a significantly reduced risk of future diabetes independent of previous treatment group.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Our objective was to quantify and predict diabetes risk reduction during the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) in participants who returned to normal glucose regulation at least once during the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) compared with those who consistently met criteria for prediabetes.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>DPPOS is an ongoing observational study of participants from the DPP randomised trial. For this analysis, diabetes cumulative incidence in DPPOS was calculated for participants with normal glucose regulation or prediabetes status during DPP with and without stratification by previous randomised treatment group. Cox proportional hazards modelling and generalised linear mixed models were used to quantify the effect of previous (DPP) glycaemic status on risk of later (DPPOS) diabetes and normal glucose regulation status, respectively, per SD in change. Included in this analysis were 1990 participants of DPPOS who had been randomly assigned to treatment groups during DPP (736 intensive lifestyle intervention, 647 metformin, 607 placebo). These studies are registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00004992 (DPP) and NCT00038727 (DPPOS).</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Diabetes risk during DPPOS was 56% lower for participants who had returned to normal glucose regulation versus those who consistently had prediabetes (hazard ratio [HR] 0·44, 95% CI 0·37-0·55, p&lt;0·0001) and was unaffected by previous group assignment (interaction test for normal glucose regulation and lifestyle intervention, p=0·1722; normal glucose regulation and metformin, p=0·3304). Many, but not all, of the variables that increased diabetes risk were inversely associated with the chance of a participant reaching normal glucose regulation status in DPPOS. Specifically, previous achievement of normal glucose regulation (odds ratio [OR] 3·18, 95% CI 2·71-3·72, p&lt;0·0001), increased β-cell function (OR 1·28; 95% CI 1·18-1·39, p&lt;0·0001), and insulin sensitivity (OR 1·16, 95% CI 1·08-1·25, p&lt;0·0001) were associated with normal glucose regulation in DPPOS, whereas the opposite was true for prediction of diabetes, with increased β-cell function (HR 0·80, 95% CI 0·71-0·89, p&lt;0·0001) and insulin sensitivity (HR 0·83, 95% CI 0·74-0·94, p=0·0001) having a protective effect. Among participants who did not return to normal glucose regulation in DPP, those assigned to the intensive lifestyle intervention had a higher diabetes risk (HR 1·31, 95% CI 1·03-1·68, p=0·0304) and lower chance of normal glucose regulation (OR 0·59, 95% CI 0·42-0·82, p=0·0014) than did the placebo group in DPPOS.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>In people with type 2 diabetes, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor is one choice as second-line treatment after metformin, with basal insulin recommended as an alternative. We aimed to compare the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of insulin glargine and sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, in patients whose disease was uncontrolled with metformin.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In this comparative, parallel, randomised, open-label trial, metformin-treated people aged 35-70 years with glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) of 7-11%, diagnosis of type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months, and body-mass index of 25-45 kg/m(2) were recruited from 17 countries. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to 24-week treatment with insulin glargine (titrated from an initial subcutaneous dose of 0·2 units per kg bodyweight to attain fasting plasma glucose of 4·0-5·5 mmol/L) or sitagliptin (oral dose of 100 mg daily). Randomisation (via a central interactive voice response system) was by random sequence generation and was stratified by centre. Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was change in HbA(1c) from baseline to study end. Efficacy analysis included all randomly assigned participants who had received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one on-treatment assessment of any primary or secondary efficacy variable.

				<fragment>Despite the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes in youth, there are few data to guide treatment. We compared the efficacy of three treatment regimens to achieve durable glycemic control in children and adolescents with recent-onset type 2 diabetes.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Eligible patients 10 to 17 years of age were treated with metformin (at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily) to attain a glycated hemoglobin level of less than 8% and were randomly assigned to continued treatment with metformin alone or to metformin combined with rosiglitazone (4 mg twice a day) or a lifestyle-intervention program focusing on weight loss through eating and activity behaviors. The primary outcome was loss of glycemic control, defined as a glycated hemoglobin level of at least 8% for 6 months or sustained metabolic decompensation requiring insulin.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Of the 699 randomly assigned participants (mean duration of diagnosed type 2 diabetes, 7.8 months), 319 (45.6%) reached the primary outcome over an average follow-up of 3.86 years. Rates of failure were 51.7% (120 of 232 participants), 38.6% (90 of 233), and 46.6% (109 of 234) for metformin alone, metformin plus rosiglitazone, and metformin plus lifestyle intervention, respectively. Metformin plus rosiglitazone was superior to metformin alone (P=0.006); metformin plus lifestyle intervention was intermediate but not significantly different from metformin alone or metformin plus rosiglitazone. Prespecified analyses according to sex and race or ethnic group showed differences in sustained effectiveness, with metformin alone least effective in non-Hispanic black participants and metformin plus rosiglitazone most effective in girls. Serious adverse events were reported in 19.2% of participants.</fragment>

		<summary>A policy of suboptimum diabetes control to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia and its consequences in advanced type 2 diabetes mellitus might be unwarranted with newer basal insulins such as degludec, which are associated with lower risks of hypoglycaemia than insulin glargine.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Basal insulin therapy does not stop loss of β-cell function, which is the hallmark of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and thus diabetes control inevitably deteriorates. Insulin degludec is a new, ultra-longacting basal insulin. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of insulin degludec compared with insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In this 52 week, phase 3, open-label, treat-to-target, non-inferiority trial, undertaken at 123 sites in 12 countries, we enrolled adults (aged ≥18 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) of 7·0-10·0% after 3 months or more of any insulin regimen (with or without oral antidiabetic drugs). We randomly allocated eligible participants in a 3:1 ratio to receive once-daily subcutaneous insulin degludec or glargine, stratified by previous insulin regimen, via a central interactive response system. Basal insulin was titrated to a target plasma glucose concentration of 3·9-&lt;5·0 mmol/L self-measured before breakfast. The primary outcome was non-inferiority of degludec to glargine measured by change in HbA(1c) from baseline to week 52 (non-inferiority limit of 0·4%) by ANOVA in the full analysis set. We assessed rates of hypoglycaemia in all treated patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00972283.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>744 (99%) of 755 participants randomly allocated degludec and 248 (99%) of 251 allocated glargine were included in the full analysis set (mean age 58·9 years [SD 9·3], diabetes duration 13·5 years [7·3], HbA(1c) 8·3% [0·8], and fasting plasma glucose 9·2 mmol/L [3·1]); 618 (82%) and 211 (84%) participants completed the trial. After 1 year, HbA(1c) decreased by 1·1% in the degludec group and 1·2% in the glargine group (estimated treatment difference [degludec-glargine] 0·08%, 95% CI -0·05 to 0·21), confirming non-inferiority. Rates of overall confirmed hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose &lt;3·1 mmol/L or severe episodes requiring assistance) were lower with degludec than glargine (11·1 vs 13·6 episodes per patient-year of exposure; estimated rate ratio 0·82, 95% CI 0·69 to 0·99; p=0·0359), as were rates of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia (1·4 vs 1·8 episodes per patient-year of exposure; 0·75, 0·58 to 0·99; p=0·0399). Rates of severe hypoglycaemia seemed similar (0·06 vs 0·05 episodes per patient-year of exposure for degludec and glargine) but were too low for assessment of differences. Rates of other adverse events did not differ between groups.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>The purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to determine the efficacy of Five-Element Gymnastics (FEG) in controlling glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) at the 8th and the 16th weeks of intervention for patients with type 2 diabetes in Taiwan. FEG consolidates several traditional Chinese exercises including Qigong, Xiang Gong, and martial arts with gymnastics. The experimental group (n = 31) practiced FEG at home for 16 weeks. The control group (n = 35) maintained usual activities. FEG was associated with decrease of HbA1C, TG, and LDL-C levels at the 8th week and continuous decrease of HbA1C through the 16th week. FEG could be an exercise choice for patients with type 2 diabetes.</fragment>

				<fragment>In this randomized, nonblinded, single-center trial, we evaluated the efficacy of intensive medical therapy alone versus medical therapy plus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy in 150 obese patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 49±8 years, and 66% were women. The average glycated hemoglobin level was 9.2±1.5%.

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Of the 150 patients, 93% completed 12 months of follow-up. The proportion of patients with the primary end point was 12% (5 of 41 patients) in the medical-therapy group versus 42% (21 of 50 patients) in the gastric-bypass group (P=0.002) and 37% (18 of 49 patients) in the sleeve-gastrectomy group (P=0.008). Glycemic control improved in all three groups, with a mean glycated hemoglobin level of 7.5±1.8% in the medical-therapy group, 6.4±0.9% in the gastric-bypass group (P&lt;0.001), and 6.6±1.0% in the sleeve-gastrectomy group (P=0.003).

The use of drugs to lower glucose, lipid, and blood-pressure levels decreased significantly after both surgical procedures but increased in patients receiving medical therapy only. The index for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) improved significantly after bariatric surgery. Four patients underwent reoperation. There were no deaths or life-threatening complications.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>The BLOOM-DM (Behavioral Modification and Lorcaserin for Obesity and Overweight Management in Diabetes Mellitus) study evaluated efficacy and safety of lorcaserin for weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes. Secondary objectives included evaluations of glycemic control, lipids, blood pressure, and quality of life. This 1-year, randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 604 patients 1:1:1 to placebo, lorcaserin 10 mg once daily (QD) or lorcaserin 10 mg twice daily (BID). Patients were treated with metformin, a sulfonylurea (SFU) or both; had glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) 7-10%; were 18-65 years old; and had BMI 27-45 kg/m(2). Patients received diet and exercise counseling. Safety monitoring included serial echocardiograms. Mean (± SD) age was 52.7 ± 8.7; 54.2% were women; 60.5% were white, 20.9% were African American, and 13.8% were Hispanic. Mean (± SD) weight was 103.6 ± 17.8 kg; BMI was 36.0 ± 4.5 kg/m(2). Most patients (91.7%) took metformin; 50.2% took a SFU. More patients lost ≥5% body weight with lorcaserin BID (37.5%; P &lt; 0.001) or lorcaserin QD (44.7%; P &lt; 0.001) vs. placebo (16.1%; modified intent to treat (MITT)/last observation carried forward (LOCF)). Least square mean (± SEM) weight change was -4.5 ± 0.35% with lorcaserin BID and -5.0 ± 0.5% with lorcaserin QD vs. -1.5 ± 0.36% with placebo (P &lt; 0.001 for each). HbA(1c) decreased 0.9 ± 0.06 with lorcaserin BID, 1.0 ± 0.09 with lorcaserin QD, and 0.4 ± 0.06 with placebo (P &lt; 0.001 for each); fasting glucose decreased 27.4 ± 2.5 mg/dl, -28.4 ± 3.8 mg/dl, and 11.9 ± 2.5 mg/dl, respectively (P &lt; 0.001 for each). Symptomatic hypoglycemia occurred in 7.4% of patients on lorcaserin BID, 10.5% on lorcaserin QD, and 6.3% on placebo. Common adverse events were headache, back pain, nasopharyngitis, and nausea. Lorcaserin was associated with significant weight loss and improvement in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.</fragment>

			<section label="CONTEXT" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Natriuretic peptides (NP) regulate cardiovascular homeostasis and have multiple metabolic properties. Decreased levels of NP or "natriuretic handicap" are signs of insulin resistance such as central obesity.

Additionally, the effect of insulin and glucose on NPR expression in the culture of primary human monocytes and macrophages was tested.</fragment>

NPRB expression was lower in VAT than in SAT in subjects with type 2 diabetes and was lower compared with nondiabetic subjects. NPRC gene expression was up-regulated in SAT during both euglycemic- and hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps (P = 0.038 and P = 0.048, respectively), and was increased in high glucose and insulin treatment in monocytes (70.2%; P = 0.01), but not in mature macrophages.</fragment>

		<summary>TAK-875 significantly improved glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes with minimum risk of hypoglycaemia. The results show that activation of FFAR1 is a viable therapeutic target for treatment of type 2 diabetes.</summary>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Activation of free fatty acid receptor 1 (FFAR1; also known as G-protein-coupled receptor 40) by fatty acids stimulated glucose-dependent β-cell insulin secretion in preclinical models. We aimed to assess whether selective pharmacological activation of this receptor by TAK-875 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus improved glycaemic control without hypoglycaemia risk.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We undertook a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, and placebo-controlled and active-comparator-controlled trial in outpatients with type 2 diabetes who had not responded to diet or metformin treatment. Patients were randomly assigned equally to receive placebo, TAK-875 (6·25, 25, 50, 100, or 200 mg), or glimepiride (4 mg) once daily for 12 weeks. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was change in haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) from baseline. Analysis included all patients randomly assigned to treatment groups who received at least one dose of double-blind study drug. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01007097.</fragment>

			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>426 patients were randomly assigned to TAK-875 (n=303), placebo (n=61), and glimepiride (n=62). At week 12, significant least-squares mean reductions in HbA(1c) from baseline occurred in all TAK-875 (ranging from -1·12% [SE 0·113] with 50 mg to -0·65% [0·114] with 6·25 mg) and glimepiride (-1·05% [SE 0·111]) groups versus placebo (-0·13% [SE 0·115]; p value range 0·001 to &lt;0·0001). Treatment-emergent hypoglycaemic events were similar in the TAK-875 and placebo groups (2% [n=7, all TAK-875 groups] vs 3% [n=2]); significantly higher rates were reported in the glimepiride group (19% [n=12]; p value range 0·010-0·002 vs all TAK-875 groups). Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar in the TAK-875 overall (49%; n=147, all TAK-875 groups) and placebo groups (48%, n=29) and was lower than in the glimepiride group (61%, n=38).</fragment>

		<content>
			<section>
				<fragment>No effective interventions to reduce risk for new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT), a condition associated with postoperative hyperglycemia and reduced patient and graft survival, have been established. In this 1-year, proof-of-concept clinical trial, we randomly assigned 50 renal transplant recipients to immediate-postoperative isophane insulin for evening blood glucose ≥140 mg/dl (treatment group) or short-acting insulin and/or oral antidiabetic agents for blood glucose ≥180-250 mg/dl (standard-of-care control group). We included only patients without a history of diabetes who received tacrolimus. By the third postoperative evening, all patients in the treatment group had blood glucose ≥140 mg/dl and were subsequently treated with basal insulin; during the first 3 weeks after transplantation, the mean ± SD daily insulin dosage was 17±11 IU/d. Among controls, 23 (92%) of 25 had blood glucose ≥200 mg/dl and 18 (72%) of 25 received standard-of-care antihyperglycemic treatment. Asymptomatic hypoglycemia occurred five times in the treatment group and once in the control group. Throughout follow-up, the treatment group had 73% lower odds of NODAT (odds ratio, 0.27) than the control group, and hemoglobin A1c was on average 0.38% lower in the treatment group than the control group. Twelve months after transplantation, all patients in the treatment group were insulin-independent, whereas 7 (28%) of 25 controls required antidiabetic agents. The groups did not differ for insulin sensitivity, but the treatment group showed better β-cell function throughout the 1-year follow-up. In conclusion, this study suggests regimens that include basal insulin significantly reduce the odds for NODAT after renal transplantation, presumably via insulin-mediated protection of β cells.</fragment>

		<summary/>
		<content>
			<section>
				<fragment>The importance of lifestyle intervention for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been underscored by the limited benefit of pharmacologic therapies. We sought to determine whether genetic variants that contribute to T2D risk modify the response of weight and waist circumference to an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) in patients with obesity and T2D. Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) is a randomized clinical trial comparing an ILI with a control condition on the risk of cardiovascular disease in overweight adults with T2D. We analyzed 28 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at/near 17 T2D-susceptibility genes in 3,903 consented participants. We genetically characterized the cohort by assessing whether T2D-susceptibility loci were overrepresented compared with a nondiabetic community-based cohort (N = 1,016). We evaluated the association of individual variants and a composite genetic risk score (GRS) with anthropometric traits at baseline and after 1-year of intervention. Look AHEAD subjects carried more T2D-susceptibility alleles than the control population. At baseline, TCF7L2 risk alleles and the highest GRS were associated with lower BMI and waist circumference. Nominally significant genotype-by-intervention interactions were detected for 1-year change in waist circumference with JAZF1, MTNR1B, and IRS1, and BMI with JAZF1. Highest GRS was associated with a greater reduction in waist circumference at year 1, although the variance in change attributable to the GRS was small. This study shows that the genetic burden associated with T2D risk does not undermine the effect of lifestyle intervention and suggests the existence of additional genomic regions, distinct from the T2D-susceptibility loci, which may enhance or mitigate weight loss.</fragment>

			<section label="CONTEXT" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Dapagliflozin, a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, reduces hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by increasing urinary glucose excretion, and weight loss is a consistent associated finding.</fragment>

				<fragment>A reduction of either blood pressure or glycemia decreases some microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes, and we studied here their combined effects. In total, 4733 older adults with established type 2 diabetes and hypertension were randomly assigned to intensive (systolic blood pressure less than 120 mm Hg) or standard (systolic blood pressure less than 140 mm Hg) blood pressure control, and separately to intensive (HbA1c less than 0.060) or standard (HbA1c 0.070-0.079) glycemic control. Prespecified microvascular outcomes were a composite of renal failure and retinopathy and nine single outcomes. Proportional hazard regression models were used without correction for type I error due to multiple tests. During a mean follow-up of 4.7 years, the primary outcome occurred in 11.4% of intensive and 10.9% of standard blood pressure patients (hazard ratio 1.08), and in 11.1% of intensive and 11.2% of standard glycemia control patients. Intensive blood pressure control only reduced the incidence of microalbuminuria (hazard ratio 0.84), and intensive glycemic control reduced the incidence of macroalbuminuria and a few other microvascular outcomes. There was no interaction between blood pressure and glycemic control, and neither treatment prevented renal failure. Thus, in older patients with established type 2 diabetes and hypertension, intensive blood pressure control improved only 1 of 10 prespecified microvascular outcomes. None of the outcomes were significantly reduced by simultaneous intensive treatment of glycemia and blood pressure, signifying the lack of an additional beneficial effect from combined treatment.</fragment>

		<updated>2012-04-11</updated>
		<summary>Across a wide range of VAs at multiple sites using a variety of autorefractors, VA measurements tend to be worse with autorefraction than manual refraction. Differences between individual autorefractor models were identified. However, even among autorefractor models that compare most favorably with manual refraction, VA variability between autorefraction and manual refraction is higher than the test-retest variability of manual refraction. The results suggest that, with current instruments, autorefraction is not an acceptable substitute for manual refraction for most clinical trials with primary outcomes dependent on best-corrected VA.</summary>

However, on average, the MR-EVA scores were slightly better than the AR-EVA scores, across the entire VA range. Furthermore, the variability between the AR-EVA scores and the MR-EVA scores was substantially greater than the test-retest variability of the MR-EVA scores (P &lt; .001).

		<summary/>
		<content>
			<section>
				<fragment>The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the effects of exenatide on BMI (primary endpoint) and cardiometabolic risk factors in nondiabetic youth with extreme obesity. Twelve children and adolescents (age 9-16 years old) with extreme obesity (BMI ≥1.2 times the 95th percentile or BMI ≥35 kg/m(2)) were enrolled in a 6-month, randomized, open-label, crossover, clinical trial consisting of two, 3-month phases: (i) a control phase of lifestyle modification and (ii) a drug phase of lifestyle modification plus exenatide. Participants were equally randomized to phase-order (i.e., starting with control or drug therapy) then crossed-over to the other treatment. BMI, body fat percentage, blood pressure, lipids, oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT), adipokines, plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, and endothelial function were assessed at baseline, 3-, and 6-months. The mean change over each 3-month phase was compared between treatments. Compared to control, exenatide significantly reduced BMI (-1.7 kg/m(2), 95% confidence interval (CI) (-3.0, -0.4), P = 0.01), body weight (-3.9 kg, 95% CI (-7.11, -0.69), P = 0.02), and fasting insulin (-7.5 mU/l, 95% CI (-13.71, -1.37), P = 0.02). Significant improvements were observed for OGTT-derived insulin sensitivity (P = 0.02) and β-cell function (P = 0.03). Compliance with the injection regimen was excellent (≥94%) and exenatide was generally well-tolerated (the most common adverse event was mild nausea in 36%). These preliminary data suggest that exenatide should be evaluated in larger, well-controlled trials for its ability to reduce BMI and improve cardiometabolic risk factors in youth with extreme obesity.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>The effects of tesaglitazar on renal function (assessed as urinary clearance of 125I-sodium iothalamate or estimated by the modification of diet in renal disease formula) were studied in a 24-week open-label trial in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients randomized to daily doses of either tesaglitazar 2 mg or pioglitazone 45 mg. The aim of the analysis was to develop a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model that could simultaneously describe the interrelationship between tesaglitazar exposure and reduction in renal function over time in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model could adequately describe the interplay between tesaglitazar and glomerular filtration rate. A one-compartment model in which the apparent clearance was influenced by glomerular filtration rate characterized the pharmacokinetics of tesaglitazar. An indirect-response model was used for the slow time course of change in glomerular filtration rate, which decreased from 100 to 78 mL/min/1.73m(2) after 12 weeks of treatment. All tesaglitazar-treated patients had a reduction in glomerular filtration rate, and available demographic variables could not explain differences in response. Patients treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor were more sensitive to tesaglitazar and had larger glomerular filtration rate decrease compared to nontreated patients. Approximately 8 weeks after discontinuing treatment, mean glomerular filtration rate had returned towards baseline. The model and data give valuable insights into the dynamic changes in glomerular filtration rate over time.</fragment>

				<fragment>Pyridoxamine dihydrochloride (Pyridorin, NephroGenex) inhibits formation of advanced glycation end products and scavenges reactive oxygen species and toxic carbonyls, but whether these actions translate into renoprotective effects is unknown. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 317 patients with proteinuric type 2 diabetic nephropathy to twice-daily placebo; Pyridorin, 150 mg twice daily; or Pyridorin, 300 mg twice daily, for 52 weeks. At baseline, the mean age ± SD was 63.9±9.5 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 17.6±8.5 years; the mean serum creatinine level was 2.2±0.6 mg/dl, and the mean protein-to-creatinine ratio was 2973±1932 mg/g. Regarding the primary end point, a statistically significant change in serum creatinine from baseline to 52 weeks was not evident in either Pyridorin group compared with placebo. However, analysis of covariance suggested that the magnitude of the treatment effect differed by baseline renal function. Among patients in the lowest tertile of baseline serum creatinine concentration, treatment with Pyridorin associated with a lower average change in serum creatinine concentration at 52 weeks (0.28, 0.07, and 0.14 mg/dl for placebo, Pyridorin 150 mg, and Pyridorin 300 mg, respectively; P=0.05 for either Pyridorin dose versus placebo); there was no evidence of a significant treatment effect in the middle or upper tertiles. In conclusion, this trial failed to detect an effect of Pyridorin on the progression of serum creatinine at 1 year, although it suggests that patients with less renal impairment might benefit.</fragment>

				<fragment>Sulodexide, a mixture of naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan polysaccharide components, has been reported to reduce albuminuria in patients with diabetes, but it is unknown whether it is renoprotective. This study reports the results from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sulodexide macroalbuminuria (Sun-MACRO) trial, which evaluated the renoprotective effects of sulodexide in patients with type 2 diabetes, renal impairment, and significant proteinuria (&gt;900 mg/d) already receiving maximal therapy with angiotensin II receptor blockers. The primary end point was a composite of a doubling of baseline serum creatinine, development of ESRD, or serum creatinine ≥6.0 mg/dl. We planned to enroll 2240 patients over approximately 24 months but terminated the study after enrolling 1248 patients. After 1029 person-years of follow-up, we did not detect any significant differences between sulodexide and placebo; the primary composite end point occurred in 26 and 30 patients in the sulodexide and placebo groups, respectively. Side effect profiles were similar for both groups. In conclusion, these data do not suggest a renoprotective benefit of sulodexide in patients with type 2 diabetes, renal impairment, and macroalbuminuria.</fragment>

				<fragment>Depressed individuals are frequently excluded from weight loss trials because of fears that weight reduction may precipitate mood disorders, as well as concerns that depressed participants will not lose weight satisfactorily. The present study examined participants in the Look AHEAD study to determine whether moderate weight loss would be associated with incident symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation, and whether symptoms of depression at baseline would limit weight loss at 1 year. Overweight/obese adults with type 2 diabetes (n = 5,145) were randomly assigned to an Intensive Lifestyle Intervention (ILI) or a usual care group, Diabetes Support and Education (DSE). Of these, 5,129 participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and had their weight measured at baseline and 1 year. Potentially significant symptoms of depression were defined by a BDI score ≥10. Participants in ILI lost 8.6 ± 6.9% of initial weight at 1 year, compared to 0.7 ± 4.8% for DSE (P &lt; 0.001, effect size = 1.33), and had a reduction of 1.4 ± 4.7 points on the BDI, compared to 0.4 ± 4.5 for DSE (P &lt; 0.001, effect size = 0.23). At 1 year, the incidence of potentially significant symptoms of depression was significantly lower in the ILI than DSE group (6.3% vs. 9.6%) (relative risk (RR) = 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.5, 0.8; P &lt; 0.001). In the ILI group, participants with and without symptoms of depression lost 7.8 ± 6.7% and 8.7 ± 6.9%, respectively, a difference not considered clinically meaningful. Intentional weight loss was not associated with the precipitation of symptoms of depression, but instead appeared to protect against this occurrence. Mild (or greater) symptoms of depression at baseline did not prevent overweight/obese individuals with type 2 diabetes from achieving significant weight loss.</fragment>

				<fragment>Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) is a randomized trial determining whether intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) aimed at long-term weight loss and increased physical fitness reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes compared to control (diabetes support and education, DSE). We investigated the correlates of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), a biomarker associated with heart failure (HF) risk, in a subsample from 15 of 16 participating centers and tested the hypothesis that ILI decreased NT-proBNP levels. Baseline and 1-year blood samples were assayed for NT-proBNP in a random sample of 1,500 without, and all 628 with, self-reported baseline CVD (cardiovascular disease) (N = 2,128). Linear models were used to assess relationships that log-transformed NT-proBNP had with CVD risk factors at baseline and that 1-year changes in NT-proBNP had with intervention assignment. At baseline, the mean (s.d.) age, BMI, and hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) were 59.6 (6.8) years, 36.0 kg/m(2) (5.8), and 7.2% (1.1), respectively. Baseline geometric mean NT-proBNP was not different by condition (ILI 53.3 vs. DSE 51.5, P = 0.45), was not associated with BMI, and was inversely associated with HbA(1c). At 1 year, ILI participants achieved an average weight loss of 8.3% compared to 0.7% in DSE. At 1 year, NT-proBNP levels increased to a greater extent in the intervention arm (ILI +21.3% vs. DSE +14.2%, P = 0.046). The increased NT-proBNP associated with ILI was correlated with changes in HbA(1c), BMI, and body composition. In conclusion, among overweight and obese persons with diabetes, an ILI that reduced weight was associated with an increased NT-proBNP.</fragment>

				<fragment>People with type 2 diabetes are at risk of cognitive impairment and brain atrophy. We aimed to compare the effects on cognitive function and brain volume of intensive versus standard glycaemic control.</fragment>

			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>The Memory in Diabetes (MIND) study was done in 52 clinical sites in North America as part of Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD), a double two-by-two factorial parallel group randomised trial. Participants (aged 55-80 years) with type 2 diabetes, high glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) concentrations (&gt;7·5%; &gt;58 mmol/mol), and a high risk of cardiovascular events were randomly assigned to receive intensive glycaemic control targeting HbA(1c) to less than 6·0% (42 mmol/mol) or a standard strategy targeting HbA(1c) to 7·0-7·9% (53-63 mmol/mol). Randomisation was via a centralised web-based system and treatment allocation was not masked from clinic staff or participants. We assessed our cognitive primary outcome, the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) score, at baseline and at 20 and 40 months. We assessed total brain volume (TBV), our primary brain structure outcome, with MRI at baseline and 40 months in a subset of participants. We included all participants with follow-up data in our primary analyses. In February, 2008, raised mortality risk led to the end of the intensive treatment and transition of those participants to standard treatment. We tested our cognitive function hypotheses with a mixed-effects model that incorporated information from both the 20 and 40 month outcome measures. We tested our MRI hypotheses with an ANCOVA model that included intracranial volume and factors used to stratify randomisation. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00182910.</fragment>

			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>We consecutively enrolled 2977 patients (mean age 62·5 years; SD 5·8) who had been randomly assigned to treatment groups in the ACCORD study. Our primary cognitive analysis was of patients with a 20-month or 40-month DSST score: 1378 assigned to receive intensive treatment and 1416 assigned to receive standard treatment. Of the 614 patients with a baseline MRI, we included 230 assigned to receive intensive treatment and 273 assigned to receive standard treatment in our primary MRI analysis at 40 months. There was no significant treatment difference in mean 40-month DSST score (difference in mean 0·32, 95% CI -0·28 to 0·91; p=0·2997). The intensive-treatment group had a greater mean TBV than the standard-treatment group (4·62, 2·0 to 7·3; p=0·0007).</fragment>

		<summary>Lifestyle modifications can prevent type 2 diabetes among overweight Japanese with impaired fasting glucose levels. In addition, identifying individuals with more deteriorated glycemic status by using 75-g oral glucose tolerance test findings or, especially, measurement of hemoglobin A(1c) levels, could enhance the efficacy of lifestyle modifications.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Previous studies demonstrated that intensive lifestyle modification can prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus among those with impaired glucose tolerance, but similar beneficial results have not been proved among those with impaired fasting glucose levels. We investigated the efficacy of lifestyle modification on type 2 diabetes incidence among those with impaired fasting glucose levels.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>The present study was an unmasked, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. A total of 641 overweight Japanese (aged 30-60 years) with impaired fasting glucose levels were recruited nationwide in Japan and randomly assigned to a frequent intervention group (n = 311) or a control group (n = 330). For 36 months after randomization, the frequent intervention group received individual instructions and follow-up support for lifestyle modification from the medical staff 9 times. The control group received similar individual instructions 4 times at 12-month intervals during the same period. The primary outcome was type 2 diabetes incidence in annual 75-g oral glucose tolerance tests, diagnosed according to World Health Organization criteria.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>There were no significant differences between the allocation groups in baseline characteristics and dropout rates. Estimated cumulative incidences of type 2 diabetes were 12.2% in the frequent intervention group and 16.6% in the control group. Overall, the adjusted hazard ratio in the frequent intervention group was 0.56 (95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.87). In the post hoc subgroup analyses, the hazard ratio reduced to 0.41 (95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.69) among participants with impaired glucose tolerance at baseline, and to 0.24 (0.12-0.48) among those with baseline hemoglobin A(1c) levels of 5.6% or more (the Japan Diabetes Society method). Such risk reduction was not observed among those with isolated impaired fasting glucose findings or baseline hemoglobin A(1c) levels of less than 5.6%.</fragment>

		<summary>The nurses were key to the delivery of the trial.

				<fragment>As practice nurses increasingly become involved in primary care research, it is important to understand not only what impact this may have on their existing role but also equally on what their potential contribution might be.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHOD" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Fourteen of the 15 practice nurses involved in the delivery of a complex intervention were purposively sampled and interviewed in their workplace between June and October 2007. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using a Framework Approach and NVivo software. Findings.  Time influenced the nurses' engagement with the various aspects of the trial and meant that they constantly had to make judgments and decisions in response to the multiple agendas presented to them: they had to negotiate a range of competing loyalties between their professional clinical role, their role in the research and practice teams and their relationship with patients. The nurses' accounts consequently provide insight into the active role they played both in the trial process and the delivery of the complex intervention.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>Hypertension is difficult to treat in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or obesity. Combination therapies are often required to effectively lower blood pressure (BP) and attain BP goals. In this post-hoc analysis of 2 prospective, randomized, controlled studies in patients with uncontrolled or untreated moderate or severe hypertension, the efficacy and safety of treatment with irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and irbesartan was assessed in 2 separate analyses: patients with diabetes (n=143) and by obesity status (n=1125). Patients received irbesartan/HCTZ (150 mg/12.5 mg titrated to 300 mg/25 mg) or irbesartan (150 mg titrated to 300 mg) for 7 (severe hypertension study) or 12 (moderate hypertension study) weeks. Efficacy comparisons between treatment groups were performed using Fisher's exact tests. After 7 to 8 weeks of treatment, systolic BP (SBP)/diastolic BP (DBP) decreased in patients with diabetes by 26.9/17.8 mm Hg and 21.8/15.8 mm Hg after irbesartan/HCTZ and irbesartan treatment, respectively (P [SBP]=0.09, P [DBP]=0.27). In obese patients (n=544), SBP/DBP decreased by 29.4/20.2 mm Hg and 20.1/15.9 mm Hg after irbesartan/HCTZ and irbesartan treatment, respectively (P&lt;0.0001). More patients with T2DM reached the BP goal of &lt;130/80 mm Hg at week 7 to 8 in the irbesartan/HCTZ group than in the irbesartan group (12% vs 5%), although not statistically significant (P=0.22). Significantly more obese patients reached their respective BP goals in the irbesartan/HCTZ group than in the irbesartan group (48% vs 23%; P&lt;0.0001). Treatment-emergent adverse event rates were similar between treatment groups regardless of the presence of diabetes or body mass index (BMI) status. In patients with moderate or severe hypertension and with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2), initial treatment with irbesartan/HCTZ combination therapy was more effective than irbesartan monotherapy.</fragment>

				<fragment>The pain associated with lancing can be a significant barrier to self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). The OneTouch® Delica™ lancing device contains features to reduce lancing pain, including improved lancet control and stability, reduced vibration, and a thinner, 33-gauge lancet. This 2-visit, randomized controlled trial assessed perceived pain of lancing with the OneTouch® Delica™ compared with 4 other common lancing devices: OneTouch® Comfort™, ACCU-CHEK® Softclix, ACCU-CHEK® Multiclix, and Ascensia® Microlet™2. Two hundred patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus were assigned to the OneTouch® Delica™ and also randomized to 1 of the 4 comparator devices (n=50 per device pair). At visit 1, we determined the minimum depth settings required to produce≥1 μL of fingertip blood for each patient with each device. At visit 2, patients lanced their fingertips with the devices at the predetermined depths and used a 150-mm visual analog scale (VAS) to rate lancing pain relative to their "usual pain" associated with SMBG. The VAS ranged from "much less painful" (0 mm) to "much more painful" (150 mm), with the midpoint (75 mm) labeled as "usual pain." Fingertip pain scores from patients using OneTouch® Delica™ were significantly lower than those obtained using OneTouch® Comfort™, ACCU-CHEK® Multiclix, and Ascensia® Microlet™2. Pain scores for OneTouch® Delica™ and ACCU-CHEK® Softclix were not significantly different. In conclusion, OneTouch® Delica™ was either less painful or no different than the comparator devices when used for fingertip lancing. Innovative lancing devices that cause less pain may improve compliance and persistence with prescribed SMBG.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>The mechanism of action of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, such as saxagliptin, makes them suitable for combination therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Genetic, cultural, and environmental differences in individuals from different regions of the world may result in differences in treatment response to oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). This post-hoc subanalysis assessed the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin as add-on therapy to metformin, glyburide, or a thiazolidinedione in patients with inadequately controlled T2DM in the United States.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In 3 phase 3 studies of patients with T2DM uncontrolled on monotherapy, 547 adult US patients were randomized to receive saxagliptin (2.5 or 5 mg/d) or placebo as add-on to metformin, glyburide, or a thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone or rosiglitazone). Efficacy was assessed as the change from baseline to week 24 in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and postprandial glucose area under the curve (PPG-AUC) and the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c&lt;7.0%. Pooled safety and tolerability data across trials were also analyzed.</fragment>

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Reductions from baseline to week 24 in HbA1c were observed in all saxagliptin treatment groups versus placebo: saxagliptin 2.5 or 5 mg plus metformin (mean difference from placebo, -0.87% and -0.89%, respectively), glyburide (-0.51% and -0.52%), or thiazolidinedione (-0.45% and -0.60%). Improvement was also observed in FPG and PPG-AUC. Adverse events for the US cohort were consistent with previously reported data from the 3 trials.

				<fragment>At 20 clinics from 2007 through 2009, 310 participants with type 1 diabetes with a broad range of DR were imaged, per the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol, with both film and digital cameras. Severity of DR was assessed centrally from film and tonally standardized digital cameras.

For major DR outcomes (≥3-step progression on the ETDRS scale and disease presence at ascending thresholds), digital vs film κ values ranged from 0.69 to 0.96 ("substantial" to "nearly perfect"). Agreement was 86% to 99%; sensitivity, 75% to 98%; and specificity, 72% to 99%. Major conclusions were similar with digital vs film gradings (odds reductions with intensive diabetes therapy for proliferative DR at EDIC years 14 to 16: 65.5% digital vs 64.3% film).</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>We examined the effects of combined pioglitazone (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) agonist) and exenatide (GLP-1 receptor agonist) therapy on hepatic fat content and plasma adiponectin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Twenty-one T2DM patients (age = 52 ± 3 years, BMI = 32.0 ± 1.5, hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) = 8.2 ± 0.4%) on diet and/or metformin received additional treatment with either pioglitazone 45 mg/day for 12 months (n = 10) or combined therapy with pioglitazone (45 mg/day) and exenatide (10 µg subcutaneously twice daily) for 12 months (n = 11). At baseline, hepatic fat content and plasma adiponectin levels were similar between the two treatment groups. Pioglitazone reduced fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (P &lt; 0.05), fasting free fatty acid (FFA) (P &lt; 0.05), and HbA(1c) (Δ = 1.0%, P &lt; 0.01), while increasing plasma adiponectin concentration by 86% (P &lt; 0.05). Hepatic fat (magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)) was significantly reduced following pioglitazone treatment (11.0 ± 3.1 to 6.5 ± 1.9%, P &lt; 0.05). Plasma triglyceride concentration decreased by 14% (P &lt; 0.05) and body weight increased significantly (Δ = 3.7 kg). Combined pioglitazone and exenatide therapy was associated with a significantly greater increase in plasma adiponectin (Δ = 193%) and a significantly greater decrease in hepatic fat (12.1 ± 1.7 to 4.7 ± 1.3%) and plasma triglyceride (38%) vs. pioglitazone therapy despite the lack of a significant change in body weight (Δ = 0.2 kg). Hepatic injury biomarkers aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were significantly decreased by both treatments; however, the reduction in ALT was significantly greater following combined pioglitazone and exenatide therapy. We conclude that combined in patients with T2DM, pioglitazone and exenatide therapy is associated with a greater reduction in hepatic fat content as compared to the addition of pioglitazone therapy (Δ = 61% vs. 41%, P &lt; 0.05).</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>Effective weight management interventions could reduce race-sex disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD), yet little is known about factors associated with successful weight loss maintenance in race-sex subgroups. In the Weight Loss Maintenance trial (WLM), overweight/obese (BMI 25-45 kg/m(2)) adults who lost ≥4 kg in a 6-month behavioral weight loss intervention (phase I) were randomized into one of three 30-month maintenance interventions (phase II). To investigate predictors in subgroups, randomized groups were combined for this analysis. Of 1,685 phase I participants, 1,032 (61%) entered phase II, including 12% black men (BM), 26% black women (BW), 25% white men (WM), and 37% white women (WW). Weight change over the 36-month study ranged from -2.3% (95% confidence interval = -3.1 to -1.5%) in BW to -4.5% (95% confidence interval = -5.7 to -4.0%) in WM, the result of differential weight loss during phase I. Within race, men lost significantly more weight than women, but within sex group, weight loss did not differ significantly between races. Although participants regained weight during phase II, regain did not differ by race-sex group, and mean weight at the end of the study was significantly lower than phase I entry weight for each subgroup. In regression models, phase I weight loss predicted overall 36-month weight loss in all race-sex groups. Healthy dietary pattern at entry, improvement in dietary pattern, or both were predictive in three of four race-sex groups. Few other variables other than initial weight loss and dietary pattern were predictive. Future research should identify additional modifiable influences on long-term maintenance after a modest weight loss.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>Intervention in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) is associated with slowing the progressive loss of renal function. During initiation of therapy, however, there may be an acute fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We tested whether this initial fall in GFR reflects a renal hemodynamic effect and whether this might result in a slower decline in long-term renal function. We performed a post hoc analysis of the Reduction of Endpoints in Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) trial. Patients assigned to losartan had a significantly greater acute fall in estimated (eGFR) during the first 3 months compared to patients assigned to placebo, but a significantly slower long-term mean decline of eGFR thereafter. A large interindividual difference, however, was noticed in the acute eGFR change. When patients were divided into tertiles of initial fall in eGFR, the long-term eGFR slope calculated from baseline was significantly higher in patients with an initial fall compared to those with an initial rise. When eGFR decline was calculated from 3 months to the final visit, excluding the initial effect, patients with a large initial fall in eGFR had a significant lower long-term eGFR slope compared to those with a moderate fall or rise. This relationship was independent of other risk markers or change in risk markers for progression of renal disease such as blood pressure and albuminuria. Thus, the greater the acute fall in eGFR, during losartan treatment, the slower the rate of long-term eGFR decline. Hence, interpretation of trial results relying on slope-based GFR outcomes should separate the initial drug-induced GFR change from the subsequent long-term effect on GFR.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>In ESRD, the neurohormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) may act primarily through V1a and V1b receptors, which promote vasoconstriction, myocardial hypertrophy, and release of adrenocorticotropic hormone. The preanalytical instability of AVP limits the investigation of whether this hormone associates with cardiovascular events, but the stable glycopeptide copeptin may serve as a surrogate because it is co-secreted with AVP from the posterior pituitary. Here, we studied whether copeptin predicts cardiovascular risk and mortality in ESRD. We measured copeptin at baseline in 1241 hemodialysis patients with type 2 diabetes participating in the German Diabetes and Dialysis Study. The median copeptin level was 81 pmol/L (interquartile range, 81 to 122 pmol/L). In Cox regression analyses, compared with patients with copeptin levels in the lowest quartile (≤51 pmol/L), patients with copeptin levels in the highest quartile (&gt;122 pmol/L) had a 3.5-fold increased risk for stroke (HR, 3.48; 95% CI: 1.71 to 7.09), a 73% higher risk for sudden death (HR, 1.73; 95% CI: 1.01 to 2.95), a 42% higher risk for combined cardiovascular events (HR, 1.42; 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.90), and a 48% higher risk for all-cause mortality (HR, 1.48; 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.90). In contrast, we did not detect significant associations between copeptin levels and risks for myocardial infarction or death caused by congestive heart failure. In conclusion, copeptin levels strongly associate with stroke, sudden death, combined cardiovascular events, and mortality in hemodialysis patients with type 2 diabetes. Whether vasopressin receptor antagonists will improve these outcomes requires further studies.</fragment>

The comparison intervention consisted of group education sessions with a DM educator and dietician followed by an additional visit with one's primary care provider.

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Insulin degludec is a new basal insulin that forms soluble multihexamer assemblies after subcutaneous injection, resulting in an ultra-long action profile. This study aimed to assess efficacy and safety of insulin degludec injected once a day or three times a week compared with insulin glargine once a day in insulin-naive people with type 2 diabetes, who were inadequately controlled with oral antidiabetic drugs.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In this 16-week, randomised, open-label, parallel-group phase 2 trial, participants aged 18–75 years with type 2 diabetes and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1C)) of 7·0–11·0% were enrolled and treated at 28 clinical sites in Canada, India, South Africa, and the USA. Participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1:1 ratio by computer-generated block randomisation to receive insulin degludec either once a day or three times a week or insulin glargine once a day, all in combination with metformin. Investigators were masked to data until database release. The primary outcome was HbA(1C) after 16 weeks of treatment. Analyses were done by intention to treat.

				<fragment>Microalbuminuria is an early predictor of diabetic nephropathy and premature cardiovascular disease. We investigated whether treatment with an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) would delay or prevent the occurrence of microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes and normoalbuminuria.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, controlled trial, we assigned 4447 patients with type 2 diabetes to receive olmesartan (at a dose of 40 mg once daily) or placebo for a median of 3.2 years. Additional antihypertensive drugs (except angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or ARBs) were used as needed to lower blood pressure to less than 130/80 mm Hg. The primary outcome was the time to the first onset of microalbuminuria. The times to the onset of renal and cardiovascular events were analyzed as secondary end points.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>The target blood pressure (&lt;130/80 mm Hg) was achieved in nearly 80% of the patients taking olmesartan and 71% taking placebo; blood pressure measured in the clinic was lower by 3.1/1.9 mm Hg in the olmesartan group than in the placebo group. Microalbuminuria developed in 8.2% of the patients in the olmesartan group (178 of 2160 patients who could be evaluated) and 9.8% in the placebo group (210 of 2139); the time to the onset of microalbuminuria was increased by 23% with olmesartan (hazard ratio for onset of microalbuminuria, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.63 to 0.94; P=0.01). The serum creatinine level doubled in 1% of the patients in each group. Slightly fewer patients in the olmesartan group than in the placebo group had nonfatal cardiovascular events--81 of 2232 patients (3.6%) as compared with 91 of 2215 patients (4.1%) (P=0.37)--but a greater number had fatal cardiovascular events--15 patients (0.7%) as compared with 3 patients (0.1%) (P=0.01), a difference that was attributable in part to a higher rate of death from cardiovascular causes in the olmesartan group than in the placebo group among patients with preexisting coronary heart disease (11 of 564 patients [2.0%] vs. 1 of 540 [0.2%], P=0.02).</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Intensive glucose lowering has previously been shown to increase mortality among persons with advanced type 2 diabetes and a high risk of cardiovascular disease. This report describes the 5-year outcomes of a mean of 3.7 years of intensive glucose lowering on mortality and key cardiovascular events.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We randomly assigned participants with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease or additional cardiovascular risk factors to receive intensive therapy (targeting a glycated hemoglobin level below 6.0%) or standard therapy (targeting a level of 7 to 7.9%). After termination of the intensive therapy, due to higher mortality in the intensive-therapy group, the target glycated hemoglobin level was 7 to 7.9% for all participants, who were followed until the planned end of the trial.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Before the intensive therapy was terminated, the intensive-therapy group did not differ significantly from the standard-therapy group in the rate of the primary outcome (a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes) (P=0.13) but had more deaths from any cause (primarily cardiovascular) (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.44) and fewer nonfatal myocardial infarctions (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.95). These trends persisted during the entire follow-up period (hazard ratio for death, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.38; and hazard ratio for nonfatal myocardial infarction, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.96). After the intensive intervention was terminated, the median glycated hemoglobin level in the intensive-therapy group rose from 6.4% to 7.2%, and the use of glucose-lowering medications and rates of severe hypoglycemia and other adverse events were similar in the two groups.</fragment>

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Liraglutide (1.2 or 1.8 mg) was superior to sitagliptin for reducing HbA(1c) from baseline (8.4-8.5%) to 52 weeks: -1.29% and -1.51% vs. -0.88% respectively. Estimated mean treatment differences between liraglutide and sitagliptin were as follows: -0.40% (95% confidence interval -0.59 to -0.22) for 1.2 mg and -0.63% (-0.81 to -0.44) for 1.8 mg (both p&lt;0.0001).

		<content>
			<section>
				<fragment>Three double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-parallel-group, multicenter phase 3 trials were conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of CP-945,598 for weight loss and weight-loss maintenance. Two trials were designed to be 2 years in duration (in obese and overweight patients) and one as a 1-year study (in obese and overweight patients with type 2 diabetes). However, the 2-year trials and the CP-945,598 development program were terminated before completion due to changing regulatory perspectives of CB1 receptor-related drugs. In total, 1,253 and 2,536 participants in the two 2-year multinational and North American studies were randomized to 10-mg CP-945,598 (n = 360; 718); 20-mg CP-945,598 (n = 534, 1,084) and placebo (n = 359, 734), respectively; and 975 participants were randomized to 10-mg CP-945,598 (n = 318); 20-mg CP-945,598 (n = 320); and placebo (n = 337) in the 1-year multinational diabetes trial. Baseline demographics were similar between treatment groups within each trial. One year of treatment with CP-945,598 resulted in a dose-related mean percentage reduction from baseline body-weight in all trials. A significant proportion of all participants also achieved 5% and 10% weight loss after 1 year. In participants with mainly well-controlled type 2 diabetes, the combination of lifestyle and CP-945,598 induced substantial improvements in glycemic control. The most frequent adverse events (AEs) for CP-945,598 were: diarrhea, nausea, nasopharyngitis, and headache. Self-reported experiences of anxiety and suicidal thoughts were higher with CP-945,598 than placebo, as were the incidence of depression and depressed mood. However, the reported increases in psychiatric symptoms were not consistently dose dependent.</fragment>

		<summary>DPP-4 inhibition augmented insulin secretory responses both after oral glucose and during isoglycemic iv glucose infusions, with no net change in the incretin effect. Thus, slight variations in basal incretin levels may be more important than previously thought.

A significant trend over time for haemoglobin A1c was found in favour of the intervention, with a statistically significant difference between groups after 9 months (P=0.02).</fragment>

				<fragment>The nurse-administered intervention had limited effects on diabetes-specific quality of life. As only certain subgroups benefited, ways of increasing effectiveness in other groups should be explored. The potentially beneficial effect on glycaemic control is encouraging and needs further research because of small numbers in the analysis.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>The primary aim of this study was to test for changes in body image in men and women enrolled in the Look AHEAD trial. Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) is a multicenter, randomized controlled trial designed to test whether intentional weight loss reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in overweight individuals with type 2 diabetes. Participants included 157 adults at one site (Pennington Biomedical Research Center (PBRC), Baton Rouge, LA) of the Look AHEAD study. At baseline, the mean BMI of the female participants was 36.4, and the mean BMI for males was 33.5. Following baseline assessment, participants were randomly assigned to the intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI, n = 81) or diabetes support and education (DSE, n = 76). The body morph assessment version 2.0 (BMA 2.0) was used to assess estimates of perceived current body size, ideal body size, acceptable body size, and body image dissatisfaction at baseline and 1 year. Over the 1 year, participants in the ILI group had significantly greater reductions in weight (10.1% for men and 8.9% for women) than those in the DSE group (+ 0.8% for men and -0.2%, for women). Perceived current body size was reduced significantly more in both men and women in the ILI group, relative to DSE. There were also significantly greater reductions in body image dissatisfaction in the ILI group, relative to the DSE group for men and women. The results of this study indicate that body image dissatisfaction improved following participation in an intensive behavioral weight loss program.</fragment>

				<fragment>An imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine productions in adipose tissue is thought to contribute to chronic, systemic, low-grade inflammation and consequently to an increased risk of cardiovascular complications in obese and type 2 diabetic patients. Nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), whose serum levels are elevated in such patients, have been shown to interfere with cytokine production in vitro. In order to evaluate the effects of elevated NEFA levels on cytokine production in adipose tissue in vivo we used an 18-gauge open-flow microperfusion (OFM) catheter to induce local inflammation in the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of healthy volunteers and to sample interstitial fluid (IF) specifically from the inflamed tissue. In two crossover studies, nine subjects received either an intravenous lipid-heparin infusion to elevate circulating NEFA levels or saline over a period of 28 h. The former increased the circulating levels of triglycerides (TGs), NEFA, glucose, and insulin over the study period. NEFA effects on locally induced inflammation were estimated by measuring the levels of a panel adipokines in the OFM probe effluent. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels increased during the study period but were not affected by lipid-heparin infusion. In contrast, the level of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was significantly reduced during the final hour of lipid-heparin infusion (saline: 449.2 ± 105.9 vs. lipid-heparin: 65.4 ± 15.4 pg/ml; P = 0.02). These data provide the first in vivo evidence that elevated NEFA can modulate cytokine production by adipose tissue.</fragment>

			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Of 691 eligible sedentary patients with T2DM and the metabolic syndrome, 606 were enrolled in 22 outpatient diabetes clinics across Italy and randomized by center, age, and diabetes treatment to twice-a-week supervised aerobic and resistance training plus structured exercise counseling (exercise group) vs counseling alone (control group) for 12 months.

		<summary>Addition of 2 μg/day paricalcitol to RAAS inhibition safely lowers residual albuminuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy, and could be a novel approach to lower residual renal risk in diabetes.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Despite treatment with renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, patients with diabetes have increased risk of progressive renal failure that correlates with albuminuria. We aimed to assess whether paricalcitol could be used to reduce albuminuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In this multinational, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, we enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria who were receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Patients were assigned (1:1:1) by computer-generated randomisation sequence to receive 24 weeks’ treatment with placebo,1 μg/day paricalcitol, or 2 μg/day paricalcitol. The primary endpoint was the percentage change in geometric mean urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) from baseline to last measurement during treatment for the combined paricalcitol groups versus the placebo group. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00421733.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Between February, 2007, and October, 2008, 281 patients were enrolled and assigned to receive placebo(n=93), 1 μg paricalcitol (n=93), or 2 μg paricalcitol (n=95); 88 patients on placebo, 92 on 1 μg paricalcitol, and 92 on2 μg paricalcitol received at least one dose of study drug, and had UACR data at baseline and at least one timepoint during treatment, and so were included in the primary analysis. Change in UACR was: –3% (from 61 to 60 mg/mmol;95% CI –16 to 13) in the placebo group; –16% (from 62 to 51 mg/mmol; –24 to –9) in the combined paricalcitol groups, with a between-group difference versus placebo of –15% (95% CI –28 to 1; p=0.071); –14% (from 63 to 54 mg/mmol; –24 to –1) in the 1 μg paricalcitol group, with a between-group difference versus placebo of –11%(95% CI –27 to 8; p=0.23); and –20% (from 61 to 49 mg/mmol; –30 to –8) in the 2 μg paricalcitol group, with a between-group difference versus placebo of –18% (95% CI –32 to 0; p=0.053). Patients on 2 μg paricalcitol showed a nearly, sustained reduction in UACR, ranging from –18% to –28% (p=0.014 vs placebo). Incidence of hypercalcaemia,adverse events, and serious adverse events was similar between groups receiving paricalcitol versus placebo.</fragment>

			<section label="AIM" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>To assess the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin vs. glipizide as add-on therapy to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycaemic control on metformin alone.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS AND PATIENTS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A total of 858 patients [age ≥ 18 years; glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c) ) &gt; 6.5 - 10.0%; on stable metformin doses ≥ 1500 mg/day] were randomised 1 : 1 to saxagliptin 5 mg/day or glipizide up-titrated as needed from 5 to 20 mg/day for 52 weeks. The primary objective was to assess if the change from baseline HbA(1c) achieved with saxagliptin plus metformin was non-inferior to glipizide plus metformin.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>The per-protocol analysis demonstrated non-inferiority of saxagliptin vs. glipizide; adjusted mean changes from baseline HbA(1c) were -0.74% vs. -0.80%, respectively; the between-group difference was 0.06% (95% CI, -0.05% to 0.16%). Treatment with saxagliptin vs. glipizide was associated with a significantly smaller proportion of patients with hypoglycaemic events (3.0% vs. 36.3%; p &lt; 0.0001) and a divergent impact on body weight (adjusted mean change from baseline -1.1 kg with saxagliptin vs. 1.1 kg with glipizide; p &lt; 0.0001). There was a significantly smaller rise in HbA(1c) (%/week) from week 24 to 52 with saxagliptin vs. glipizide (0.001% vs. 0.004%; p = 0.04) indicating a sustained glycaemic effect beyond week 24. Excluding hypoglycaemic events, the proportion of patients experiencing adverse events (AEs) was similar (60.0% saxagliptin vs. 56.7% glipizide); treatment-related AEs were less common with saxagliptin vs. glipizide (9.8% vs. 31.2%), attributable to the higher frequency of hypoglycaemia in glipizide patients. Discontinuation rates resulting from AEs were similar (∼4%).</fragment>

		<summary>Insulin resistance may be a marker of AD risk that is associated with reduced CMRglu and subtle cognitive impairments at the earliest stage of disease, even before the onset of mild cognitive impairment.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Insulin resistance is a causal factor in prediabetes (PD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and increases the risk of developing Alzheimer disease (AD). Reductions in cerebral glucose metabolic rate (CMRglu) as measured by fludeoxyglucose F 18-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in parietotemporal, frontal, and cingulate cortices are associated with increased AD risk and can be observed years before dementia onset.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="OBJECTIVES" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>To examine whether greater homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) is associated with reduced resting CMRglu in areas vulnerable in AD in cognitively normal adults with newly diagnosed PD or T2D (PD/T2D), and to determine whether adults with PD/T2D have abnormal patterns of CMRglu during a memory encoding task.</fragment>

			</section>
			<section label="SETTING" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>University imaging center and Veterans Affairs clinical research unit.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="PARTICIPANTS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Twenty-three older adults (mean [SEM] age, 74.4 [1.4] years) with no prior diagnosis of diabetes but who met American Diabetes Association glycemic criteria for PD (n = 11) or diabetes (n = 12) based on fasting or 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) glucose values and 6 adults (mean [SEM] age, 74.3 [2.8] years) with normal fasting glucose values and glucose tolerance. No participant met Petersen criteria for mild cognitive impairment.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="INTERVENTIONS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Fasting participants underwent resting and cognitive activation FDG-PET imaging on separate days. Following a 30-minute transmission scan, subjects received an intravenous injection of 5 mCi of FDG, and the emission scan commenced 40 minutes after injection. In the activation condition, a 35-minute memory encoding task was initiated at the time of tracer injection. Subjects were instructed to remember a repeating list of 20 words randomly presented in series through earphones. Delayed free recall was assessed once the emission scan was complete.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>The HOMA-IR value was calculated using fasting glucose and insulin values obtained during OGTT screening and then correlated with CMRglu values obtained during the resting scan. Resting CMRglu values were also subtracted from CMRglu values obtained during the memory encoding activation scan to examine task-related patterns of CMRglu.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Greater insulin resistance was associated with an AD-like pattern of reduced CMRglu in frontal, parietotemporal, and cingulate regions in adults with PD/T2D. The relationship between CMRglu and HOMA-IR was independent of age, 2-hour OGTT glucose concentration, or apolipoprotein E ε4 allele carriage. During the memory encoding task, healthy adults showed activation in right anterior and inferior prefrontal cortices, right inferior temporal cortex, and medial and posterior cingulate regions. Adults with PD/T2D showed a qualitatively different pattern during the memory encoding task, characterized by more diffuse and extensive activation, and recalled fewer items on the delayed memory test.</fragment>

			<section label="RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A three-arm practical randomized trial was conducted to evaluate minimal contact and moderate contact versions of an Internet-based diabetes self-management program, offered in English and Spanish, compared to enhanced usual care. A heterogeneous sample of 463 type 2 patients was randomized and 82.5% completed a 4-month follow-up. Primary outcomes were behavior changes in healthy eating, physical activity, and medication taking. Secondary outcomes included hemoglobin A1c, body mass index, lipids, and blood pressure.</fragment>

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>The Internet-based intervention produced significantly greater improvements than the enhanced usual care condition on three of four behavioral outcomes (effect sizes [d] for healthy eating = 0.32; fat intake = 0.28; physical activity= 0.19) in both intent-to-treat and complete-cases analyses. These changes did not translate into differential improvements in biological outcomes during the 4-month study period.

		<summary>Obesity is associated with an attenuated overall postprandial decrease in AIx. Subjects with T2DM have a preserved, but significantly prolonged, reduction in AIx after a high-fat meal. The correlation between AIx and triglycerides suggests that postprandial dysmetabolism may impact on vascular dynamics. The markedly different response observed in the obese subjects compared with those with T2DM was unexpected and warrants additional evaluation.</summary>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Insulin therapy is often a delayed strategy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus because it is associated with weight gain, hypoglycaemia, and the need for subcutaneous injections.

			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In this randomised, open-label, parallel-group study, adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and poor glycaemic control despite insulin therapy, with or without oral antidiabetes drugs, were enrolled from ten countries between Feb 23, 2006, and Aug 8, 2007. Patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive 52 weeks' treatment with: prandial Technosphere inhaled insulin powder plus bedtime insulin glargine; or twice daily premixed biaspart insulin (70% insulin aspart protamine suspension and 30% insulin aspart of rDNA origin). The primary endpoint was a comparison of change in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) from baseline to week 52 between treatment groups; the non-inferiority margin was 0.4%. Analysis was by per protocol for non-inferiority testing of the primary endpoint. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00309244.</fragment>

Change in HbA(1c) with inhaled insulin plus insulin glargine (-0.68%, SE 0.077, 95% CI -0.83 to -0.53) was similar and non-inferior to that with biaspart insulin (-0.76%, 0.071, -0.90 to -0.62). The between-group difference was 0.07% (SE 0.102, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.27). Patients had significantly lower weight gain and had fewer mild-to-moderate and severe hypoglycaemic events on inhaled insulin plus insulin glargine than on biaspart insulin. The safety and tolerability profile was similar for both treatments, apart from increased occurrence of cough and change in pulmonary function in the group receiving inhaled insulin plus insulin glargine.</fragment>

Patients were randomly assigned to add exenatide (2 mg, once-a-week injection) or insulin glargine (once-daily injection, starting dose 10 IU, target glucose range 4.0-5.5 mmol/L) to their blood-glucose-lowering regimens. Randomisation was with a one-to-one allocation and block size four, stratified according to country and concomitant treatment (70% metformin only; 30% metformin plus sulphonylurea). Participants and clinical investigators were not masked to assignment, but investigators analysing data were.

		<summary>The goal of many clinicians who manage diabetes is to achieve optimum glucose control alongside weight loss and a minimum number of hypoglycaemic episodes. Addition of exenatide once weekly to metformin achieved this goal more often than did addition of maximum daily doses of either sitagliptin or pioglitazone.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Most patients with type 2 diabetes begin pharmacotherapy with metformin, but eventually need additional treatment. We assessed the safety and efficacy of once weekly exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, versus maximum approved doses of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, sitagliptin, or the thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone, in patients treated with metformin.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In this 26-week randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, superiority trial, patients with type 2 diabetes who had been treated with metformin, and at baseline had mean glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) of 8.5% (SD 1.1), fasting plasma glucose of 9.1 mmol/L (2.6), and weight of 88.0 kg (20.1), were enrolled and treated at 72 sites in the USA, India, and Mexico. Patients were randomly assigned to receive: 2 mg injected exenatide once weekly plus oral placebo once daily; 100 mg oral sitagliptin once daily plus injected placebo once weekly; or 45 mg oral pioglitazone once daily plus injected placebo once weekly. Primary endpoint was change in HbA(1c) between baseline and week 26. Analysis was by intention to treat, for all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00637273.</fragment>

				<fragment>170 patients were assigned to receive once weekly exenatide, 172 to receive sitagliptin, and 172 to receive pioglitazone. 491 patients received at least one dose of study drug and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (160 on exenatide, 166 on sitagliptin, and 165 on pioglitazone). Treatment with exenatide reduced HbA(1c) (least square mean -1.5%, 95% CI -1.7 to -1.4) significantly more than did sitagliptin (-0.9%, -1.1 to -0.7) or pioglitazone (-1.2%, -1.4 to -1.0). Treatment differences were -0.6% (95% CI -0.9 to -0.4, p&lt;0.0001) for exenatide versus sitagliptin, and -0.3% (-0.6 to -0.1, p=0.0165) for exenatide versus pioglitazone. Weight loss with exenatide (-2.3 kg, 95% CI-2.9 to -1.7) was significantly greater than with sitagliptin (difference -1.5 kg, 95% CI -2.4 to -0.7, p=0.0002) or pioglitazone (difference -5.1 kg, -5.9 to -4.3, p&lt;0.0001).

			<section>
				<fragment>Lifestyle interventions have resulted in weight loss or improved physical fitness among individuals with obesity, which may lead to improved physical function. This prospective investigation involved participants in the Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) trial who reported knee pain at baseline (n = 2,203). The purposes of this investigation were to determine whether an Intensive Lifestyle Intervention (ILI) condition resulted in improvement in self-reported physical function from baseline to 12 months vs. a Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) condition, and whether changes in weight or fitness mediated the effect of the ILI. Outcome measures included the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain, stiffness, and physical function subscales, and WOMAC summary score. ILI participants exhibited greater adjusted mean weight loss (s.e.) vs. DSE participants (-9.02 kg (0.48) vs. -0.78 kg (0.49); P &lt; 0.001)). ILI participants also demonstrated more favorable change in WOMAC summary scores vs. DSE participants (β (s.e.) = -1.81 (0.63); P = 0.004). Multiple regression mediation analyses revealed that weight loss was a mediator of the effect of the ILI intervention on change in WOMAC pain, function, and summary scores (P &lt; 0.001). In separate analyses, increased fitness also mediated the effect of the ILI intervention upon WOMAC summary score (P &lt; 0.001). The ILI condition resulted in significant improvement in physical function among overweight and obese adults with diabetes and knee pain. The ILI condition also resulted in significant weight loss and improved fitness, which are possible mechanisms through which the ILI condition improved physical function.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>Treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with pioglitazone changes abdominal fat in the opposite direction as treatment with glipizide. To determine whether these two medications affect adipose tissue meal fatty acid storage differently we studied 19 T2DM treated with either pioglitazone (n = 8) or glipizide (n = 11) and 11 non-DM control subjects matched for age, BMI, abdominal and leg fat. A breakfast mixed meal containing [1-(14)C]triolein was given and abdominal and femoral subcutaneous (sc) adipose tissue biopsies were collected 6 and 24 h later to measure meal fatty acid storage. The portion of meal fatty acids stored in upper body sc and lower body sc adipose tissue did not differ between non-DM and T2DM subjects either at 6 or 24 h. Likewise, meal fatty acid storage did not differ between the T2DM participants treated with pioglitazone or glipizide. We conclude that meal fatty acid storage in upper body and lower body sc adipose tissue is not abnormal in T2DM patients treated with pioglitazone or glipizide.</fragment>

		<summary>These results demonstrate that decreasing VAT through omentectomy, alone or in combination with RYGB surgery, does not improve metabolic function in obese patients.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is an important risk factor for the metabolic complications associated with obesity. Therefore, a reduction in VAT is considered an important target of obesity therapy. We evaluated whether reducing VAT mass by surgical removal of the omentum improves insulin sensitivity and metabolic function in obese patients.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We conducted a 12-month randomized controlled trial to determine whether reducing VAT by omentectomy in 22 obese subjects increased their improvement following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery in hepatic and skeletal muscle sensitivity to insulin study 1. Improvement was assessed by using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique. We also performed a 3-month, longitudinal, single-arm study to determine whether laparoscopic omentectomy alone, in 7 obese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), improved insulin sensitivity study 2. Improvement was assessed by using the Frequently Sampled Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>The greater omentum, which weighed 0.82 kg (95% confidence interval: 0.67-0.97), was removed from subjects who had omentectomy in both studies. In study 1, there was an approximate 2-fold increase in muscle insulin sensitivity (relative increase in glucose disposal during insulin infusion) and a 4-fold increase in hepatic insulin sensitivity 12 months after RYGB alone and RYGB plus omentectomy, compared with baseline values (P&lt;.001). There were no significant differences between groups (P&gt;.87) or group x time interactions (P&gt;.36). In study 2, surgery had no effect on insulin sensitivity (P=.844) or use of diabetes medications.</fragment>

		<summary>In patients with type 2 diabetes, adding sitagliptin to metformin monotherapy improved glycaemic control over 2 years, similar to the glucose-lowering efficacy observed with adding glipizide, but with greater durability and generally better maintenance of beta-cell function.

			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>For the PP cohort, mean baseline HbA(1c) was 7.3% in both groups. After 2 years, the least squares (LS) mean change in HbA(1c) from baseline [95% confidence interval (CI)] was -0.54% (-0.64, -0.45) with sitagliptin (n = 248) and -0.51% (-0.60, -0.42) with glipizide (n = 256). The rise in HbA(1c) from week 24 to week 104 [i.e. coefficient of durability (COD)] was smaller with sitagliptin [COD (95% CI) 0.16%/year (0.10, 0.21)] compared with glipizide [0.26%/year (0.21, 0.31)]. The proportion of patients with an HbA(1c)&lt; 7% was 63% and 59% with sitagliptin and glipizide, respectively. The beta-cell responsiveness to a meal challenge was maintained with sitagliptin and decreased with glipizide. The proportion of patients who reported hypoglycaemia was 5% with sitagliptin and 34% with glipizide [difference in proportions (95% CI) = -29% (-33, -25)].

				<fragment>EAITQ and EWITQ data were available for 240 patients (61% male, mean age 58 years, mean diabetes duration 10 years, mean baseline HbA(1c) 8.4%).

				<fragment>Sergliflozin, the active entity of sergliflozin etabonate, is a selective inhibitor of sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2). The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sergliflozin were evaluated following single oral dose administration of sergliflozin etabonate (5-500 mg) in healthy volunteers (n = 22) and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 8). The prodrug was rapidly and extensively converted to sergliflozin; the latter displayed linear kinetics, reached maximum plasma concentrations at approximately 30 to 45 minutes postdose (t(max)), and had a plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2)) of approximately 0.5 to 1 hour. Both prodrug and active entity showed low glomerular filtration and/or extensive renal tubular reabsorption, with &lt;0.5% of the administered dose being recovered in the urine. In both populations, sergliflozin etabonate produced a dose-related glucosuria under fasting conditions and following glucose loading but did not appreciably affect urinary electrolyte excretion or fluid balance. The magnitude and duration of the glucosuric effect closely paralleled plasma sergliflozin concentrations. Sergliflozin did not significantly affect fasting plasma glucose levels but produced transient attenuation of the plasma glucose AUC following glucose challenge. Single doses of sergliflozin etabonate 5 to 500 mg were well tolerated, and there were no clinically significant adverse laboratory findings.</fragment>

				<fragment>Statins improve cardiovascular survival in both nondiabetic and diabetic patients, but diabetic patients benefit more, in both primary and secondary prevention. Statins seem to have multiple effects beyond cholesterol lowering, that is, pleiotropic effects that may include changes in renal function. This study tests the hypothesis that acute treatment with atorvastatin may change glomerular filtration rate, tubular function, vasoactive hormones, blood pressure, and pulse rate in patients with type 2 diabetes. In an acute, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial, the effects of atorvastatin on renal function, vasoactive hormones, blood pressure, and pulse rate are measured in 21 patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients are randomized to either 2 doses of atorvastatin 80 mg or placebo before 2 different study days. Treatment with atorvastatin induces a significant reduction in fractional sodium excretion compared with placebo, and sodium clearance tends to be reduced. No significant differences in glomerular filtration rate, albumin/creatinine ratio, vasoactive hormones, and blood pressure by acute treatment with atorvastatin are found in diabetic patients. Acute treatment with atorvastatin reduces renal fractional sodium excretion in patients with type 2 diabetes. No changes are measured in glomerular filtration rate, albumin/creatinine ratio, vasoactive hormones, and blood pressure.</fragment>

				<fragment>Low-carbohydrate diets have been associated with significant reductions in weight and HbA(1c) in obese, diabetic participants who received high-intensity lifestyle modification for 6 or 12 months. This investigation sought to determine whether comparable results to those of short-term, intensive interventions could be achieved over a 24-month study period using a low-intensity intervention that approximates what is feasible in outpatient practice. A total of 144 obese, diabetic participants were randomly assigned to a low-carbohydrate diet (&lt;30 g/day) or to a low fat diet (&lt;or=30% of calories from fat with a deficit of 500 kcal/day). Participants were provided weekly group nutrition education sessions for the first month, and monthly sessions thereafter through the end of 24 months. Weight, HbA(1c), glucose, and lipids were measured at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months. Of the 144 enrolled participants, 68 returned for the month 24 assessment visit. Weights were retrieved from electronic medical records for an additional 57 participants (total, 125 participants) at month 24. All participants with a baseline measurement and at least one of the three other measurements were included in the mixed-model analyses (n = 138). The low-intensity intervention resulted in modest weight loss in both groups at month 24. At this time, participants in the low-carbohydrate group lost 1.5 kg, compared to 0.2 kg in the low-fat group (P = 0.147). Lipids, glycemic indexes, and dietary intake did not differ between groups at month 24 (or at months 6 or 12) (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00108459).</fragment>

				<fragment>Elevated asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) concentrations predict cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It has been shown that alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) improves endothelial function and oxidative stress in these patients. The present study investigated if ALA reduces ADMA in patients with T2DM. Plasma concentrations of ADMA, L-arginine and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) were determined in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients with T2DM. Intravenous ALA (n = 16) or placebo (n = 14) was administered daily for 3 weeks. ALA reduced ADMA while no change was observed with placebo (mean change -0.05 micromol/1[95% CI: -0.01; -0.09] vs. 0.01 micromol/1 [95% CI: -0.05; -0.03]; ANOVA p = 0.031). SDMA and L-arginine were not affected by ALA. In conclusion ALA treatment reduces ADMA in patients with T2DM. Long-term studies need to demonstrate if ALA may cause cardiovascular risk reduction.</fragment>

				<fragment>Pericardial and abdominal fat volumes and myocardial left ventricular function were measured by magnetic resonance imaging and hepatic and myocardial triglyceride content by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results: Pioglitazone increased pericardial fat volume [30.5 +/- 1.7 ml (baseline) vs. 33.1 +/- 1.8 ml], whereas metformin did not affect pericardial fat volume (29.2 +/- 1.5 ml vs. 29.6 +/- 1.6 ml, between groups P = 0.02). After correction for body mass index and age, only visceral fat volume correlated with pericardial fat volume at baseline (r = 0.55, P &lt; 0.001). The increase in pericardial fat volume induced by pioglitazone was not associated with a decrease in left ventricular diastolic function.</fragment>

		<summary>During follow-up after DPP, incidences in the former placebo and metformin groups fell to equal those in the former lifestyle group, but the cumulative incidence of diabetes remained lowest in the lifestyle group. Prevention or delay of diabetes with lifestyle intervention or metformin can persist for at least 10 years.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>In the 2.8 years of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) randomised clinical trial, diabetes incidence in high-risk adults was reduced by 58% with intensive lifestyle intervention and by 31% with metformin, compared with placebo. We investigated the persistence of these effects in the long term.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>All active DPP participants were eligible for continued follow-up. 2766 of 3150 (88%) enrolled for a median additional follow-up of 5.7 years (IQR 5.5-5.8). 910 participants were from the lifestyle, 924 from the metformin, and 932 were from the original placebo groups. On the basis of the benefits from the intensive lifestyle intervention in the DPP, all three groups were offered group-implemented lifestyle intervention. Metformin treatment was continued in the original metformin group (850 mg twice daily as tolerated), with participants unmasked to assignment, and the original lifestyle intervention group was offered additional lifestyle support. The primary outcome was development of diabetes according to American Diabetes Association criteria. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00038727.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>During the 10.0-year (IQR 9.0-10.5) follow-up since randomisation to DPP, the original lifestyle group lost, then partly regained weight. The modest weight loss with metformin was maintained. Diabetes incidence rates during the DPP were 4.8 cases per 100 person-years (95% CI 4.1-5.7) in the intensive lifestyle intervention group, 7.8 (6.8-8.8) in the metformin group, and 11.0 (9.8-12.3) in the placebo group. Diabetes incidence rates in this follow-up study were similar between treatment groups: 5.9 per 100 person-years (5.1-6.8) for lifestyle, 4.9 (4.2-5.7) for metformin, and 5.6 (4.8-6.5) for placebo. Diabetes incidence in the 10 years since DPP randomisation was reduced by 34% (24-42) in the lifestyle group and 18% (7-28) in the metformin group compared with placebo.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>Type 2 diabetes is associated with obesity and is increasing at an alarming rate in youth. Although weight loss through lifestyle change is one of the primary treatment recommendations for adults with type 2 diabetes, the efficacy of this approach has not been tested with youth. This paper provides a summary of the reviews and meta-analyses of pediatric weight-loss interventions that informed the design and implementation of an intensive, family-based lifestyle weight management program for adolescents with type 2 diabetes and their families developed for the Treatment Options for type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study. A total of 1092 youth have been screened, and 704 families have been randomized for inclusion in this 15-center clinical trial sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. The TODAY study is designed to test three approaches (metformin, metformin plus rosiglitazone and metformin plus an intensive lifestyle intervention) to the treatment of a diverse cohort of youth, 10-17 years of age, within 2 years of their diagnosis. The principal goal of the TODAY Lifestyle Program (TLP) is to decrease baseline weight of youth by 7-10% (or the equivalent for children who are growing in height) through changes in eating and physical activity habits, and to sustain these changes through ongoing treatment contact. The TLP is implemented by interventionists called Personal Activity and Nutrition Leaders (PALs) and delivered to youth with type 2 diabetes, and at least one family support person. The TLP provides a model for taking a comprehensive, continuous care approach to the treatment of severe overweight in youth with comorbid medical conditions such as type 2 diabetes.</fragment>

		<content>
			<section>
				<fragment>The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of a commercially available weight loss program on weight and glycemic control among obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Participants included 69 patients (49 females, 20 males) with type 2 diabetes who had a mean +/- SD age of 52.2 +/- 9.5 years, a body mass index of 39.0 +/- 6.2 kg/m(2), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 7.5 +/- 1.6%. Over half (52.2%) of the participants were African American. Participants were randomly assigned to: 1) a portion-controlled diet (NutriSystem D) (PCD) or 2) a diabetes support and education (DSE) program. After the initial 3 months, the PCD group continued on the PCD for the remaining 3 months, and the DSE group crossed over to PCD for the remaining 3 months. The primary comparison for this study was at 3 months. At 3 months, the PCD group lost significantly more weight (7.1 +/- 4%) than the DSE group (0.4 +/- 2.3%) (P &lt; 0.0001). From 3 to 6 months the change in weight for both groups was statistically significant. After 3 months, the PCD group had greater reductions in HbA1c than the DSE group (-0.88 +/- 1.1 vs 0.03 +/- 1.09; P &lt; 0.001). From 3 to 6 months the PCD group had no further change in HbA1c, while the DSE group showed a significant reduction. These data suggest that obese patients with type 2 diabetes will experience significant improvements in weight, glycemic control, and cardiovascular disease risk factors after the use of a commercially available weight management program.</fragment>

				<fragment>The objective of this study was to establish effects of liraglutide on the QTc interval. In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study, 51 healthy participants were administered placebo, 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 mg liraglutide once daily for 7 days each. Electrocardiograms were recorded periodically over 24 hours at the end of placebo and highest dosing periods. Four different models for QT correction were used: QTci, as the primary endpoint, and QTciL, QTcF, and QTcB as secondary endpoints. The upper bound of the 1-sided 95% confidence interval for time-matched, baseline-corrected, placebo-subtracted QTc intervals was &lt;10 ms for all 4 correction methods. Moxifloxacin (400 mg) increased QTc intervals by 10.6 to 12.3 ms at 2 hours. There was no concentration-exposure dependency on QTc interval changes by liraglutide and no QTc thresholds above 500 ms or QTc increases &gt;60 ms. The authors conclude that liraglutide caused no clinically relevant increases in the QTc interval.</fragment>

		<summary>In intermittently fed ischaemic stroke patients, strict glycaemic control between day 2 and day 5 with two different basal bolus regimens did not result in lower glucose profiles due to postprandial hyperglycaemia. Continuous enteral feeding may therefore be needed to achieve prolonged strict glycaemic control in acute stroke patients.</summary>

		<summary>Low circulating levels of sex hormone-binding globulin are a strong predictor of the risk of type 2 diabetes in women and men. The clinical usefulness of both SHBG genotypes and plasma levels in stratification and intervention for the risk of type 2 diabetes warrants further examination.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Circulating sex hormone-binding globulin levels are inversely associated with insulin resistance, but whether these levels can predict the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is uncertain.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We performed a nested case-control study of postmenopausal women in the Women's Health Study who were not using hormone therapy (359 with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and 359 controls). Plasma levels of sex hormone-binding globulin were measured; two polymorphisms of the gene encoding sex hormone-binding globulin, SHBG, that were robustly associated with the protein levels were genotyped and applied in mendelian randomization analyses. We then conducted a replication study in an independent cohort of men from the Physicians' Health Study II (170 with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and 170 controls).</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Among women, higher plasma levels of sex hormone-binding globulin were prospectively associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes: multivariable odds ratios were 1.00 for the first (lowest) quartile of plasma levels, 0.16 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.08 to 0.33) for the second quartile, 0.04 (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.12) for the third quartile, and 0.09 (95% CI, 0.03 to 0.21) for the fourth (highest) quartile (P&lt;0.001 for trend). These prospective associations were replicated among men (odds ratio for the highest quartile of plasma levels vs. the lowest quartile, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.36; P&lt;0.001 for trend). As compared with homozygotes of the respective wild-type allele, carriers of a variant allele of the SHBG single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6259 had 10% higher sex hormone-binding globulin levels (P=0.005), and carriers of an rs6257 variant had 10% lower plasma levels (P=0.004); variants of both SNPs were also associated with a risk of type 2 diabetes in directions corresponding to their associated sex hormone-binding globulin levels. In mendelian randomization analyses, the predicted odds ratio of type 2 diabetes per standard-deviation increase in the plasma level of sex hormone-binding globulin was 0.28 (95% CI, 0.13 to 0.58) among women and 0.29 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.58) among men, a finding that suggests that sex hormone-binding globulin may have a causal role in the risk of type 2 diabetes.</fragment>

				<fragment>The HEALTHY study was a multi-site randomized trial designed to determine whether a 3-year school-based intervention targeting nutrition and physical activity behaviors could effectively reduce risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes in middle school children. Pilot and formative studies were conducted to inform the development of the intervention components and the process evaluation methods for the main trial. During the main trial, both qualitative and quantitative assessments monitored the fidelity of the intervention and motivated modifications to improve intervention delivery. Structured observations of physical education classes, total school food environments, classroom-based educational modules, and communications and promotional campaigns provided verification that the intervention was delivered as intended. Interviews and focus groups yielded a multidimensional assessment of how the intervention was delivered and received, as well as identifying the barriers to and facilitators of the intervention across and within participating schools. Interim summaries of process evaluation data were presented to the study group as a means of ensuring standardization and quality of the intervention across the seven participating centers. Process evaluation methods and procedures documented the fidelity with which the HEALTHY study was implemented across 21 intervention schools and identified ways in which the intervention delivery might be enhanced throughout the study.</fragment>

				<fragment>The HEALTHY study was a randomized, controlled, multicenter, middle school-based, multifaceted intervention designed to reduce risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes. The study randomized 42 middle schools to intervention or control, and followed students from the sixth to the eighth grades. Participants were a racially, ethnically and geographically diverse cohort from across the United States. Here, we describe the conceptual underpinnings and design of the social marketing-based communications component of the HEALTHY study intervention that combined changes in the school nutrition and physical education (PE) environment with behavior change initiatives. The communications intervention component coordinated multiple elements to deliver campaigns that served to integrate and support all aspects of the HEALTHY intervention. The campaigns unfolded across five semesters of middle school, each targeting a specific theme related to the HEALTHY objectives. Communications campaigns comprised (1) core elements such as branding, posters, banners and visual and verbal messaging, (2) student events supporting the nutrition, PE and behavior intervention components through the application of social marketing and communications strategies, including the incorporation of student-generated media and (3) distribution of premiums and theme enhancers to extend the visibility of the study beyond the intervention environment. Formative research conducted with students, parents and school administrators was used to refine the communications strategy. Student peer communicators selected from the student body were involved to influence the normative student environment. Marketing and creative design experts developed a brand, logo, activities and materials. In the latter half of the study, student-generated messages and media were used to reflect local interests and culture and enhance peer influence. The HEALTHY intervention delivery and impact were strengthened by the communications strategies. The HEALTHY experience provides practical considerations for systematically incorporating a social marketing-based communications approach within future school-based health behavior interventions.</fragment>

				<fragment>HEALTHY was a multi-center primary prevention trial designed to reduce risk factors for type 2 diabetes in adolescents. Seven centers each recruited six middle schools that were randomized to either intervention or control. The HEALTHY intervention integrated multiple components in nutrition, physical education, behavior change and communications and promotion. The conceptual rationale as well as the design and development of the behavior intervention component are described. Pilot study data informed the development of the behavior intervention component. Principles of social learning and health-related behavior change were incorporated. One element of the behavior intervention component was a sequence of peer-led, teacher-facilitated learning activities known as FLASH (Fun Learning Activities for Student Health). Five FLASH modules were implemented over five semesters of the HEALTHY study, with the first module delivered in the second semester of the sixth grade and the last module in the second semester of the eighth grade. Each module contained sessions that were designed to be delivered on a weekly basis to foster self-awareness, knowledge, decision-making skills and peer involvement for health behavior change. FLASH behavioral practice incorporated individual and group self-monitoring challenges for eating and activity. Another element of the behavior intervention component was the family outreach strategy for extending changes in physical activity and healthy eating beyond the school day and for supporting the student's lifestyle change choices. Family outreach strategies included the delivery of newsletters and supplemental packages with materials to promote healthy behavior in the home environment during school summer and winter holiday breaks. In conclusion, the HEALTHY behavior intervention component, when integrated with total school food and physical education environmental changes enhanced by communications and promotional campaigns, is a feasible and acceptable mechanism for delivering age-appropriate social learning for healthy eating and physical activity among an ethnically diverse group of middle school students across the United States.</fragment>

				<fragment>The HEALTHY primary prevention trial was designed and implemented in response to the growing numbers of children and adolescents being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The objective was to moderate risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Modifiable risk factors measured were indicators of adiposity and glycemic dysregulation: body mass index &gt; or =85th percentile, fasting glucose &gt; or =5.55 mmol l(-1) (100 mg per 100 ml) and fasting insulin &gt; or =180 pmol l(-1) (30 microU ml(-1)). A series of pilot studies established the feasibility of performing data collection procedures and tested the development of an intervention consisting of four integrated components: (1) changes in the quantity and nutritional quality of food and beverage offerings throughout the total school food environment; (2) physical education class lesson plans and accompanying equipment to increase both participation and number of minutes spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity; (3) brief classroom activities and family outreach vehicles to increase knowledge, enhance decision-making skills and support and reinforce youth in accomplishing goals; and (4) communications and social marketing strategies to enhance and promote changes through messages, images, events and activities. Expert study staff provided training, assistance, materials and guidance for school faculty and staff to implement the intervention components. A cohort of students were enrolled in sixth grade and followed to end of eighth grade. They attended a health screening data collection at baseline and end of study that involved measurement of height, weight, blood pressure, waist circumference and a fasting blood draw. Height and weight were also collected at the end of the seventh grade. The study was conducted in 42 middle schools, six at each of seven locations across the country, with 21 schools randomized to receive the intervention and 21 to act as controls (data collection activities only). Middle school was the unit of sample size and power computation, randomization, intervention and primary analysis.</fragment>

				<fragment>The HEALTHY primary prevention trial was designed to reduce risk factors for type 2 diabetes in middle school students. Middle schools at seven centers across the United States participated in the 3-year study. Half of them were randomized to receive a multi-component intervention. The intervention integrated nutrition, physical education (PE) and behavior changes with a communications strategy of promotional and educational materials and activities. The PE intervention component was developed over a series of pilot studies to maximize student participation and the time (in minutes) spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), while meeting state-mandated PE guidelines. The goal of the PE intervention component was to achieve &gt; or =150 min of MVPA in PE classes every 10 school days with the expectation that it would provide a direct effect on adiposity and insulin resistance, subsequently reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes in youth. The PE intervention component curriculum used standard lesson plans to provide a comprehensive approach to middle school PE. Equipment and PE teacher assistants were provided for each school. An expert in PE at each center trained the PE teachers and assistants, monitored delivery of the intervention and provided ongoing feedback and guidance.</fragment>

				<fragment>The HEALTHY study was a randomized, controlled, multicenter and middle school-based, multifaceted intervention designed to reduce risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes. The study randomized 42 middle schools to intervention or control, and followed students from the sixth to the eighth grades. Here we describe the design of the HEALTHY nutrition intervention component that was developed to modify the total school food environment, defined to include the following: federal breakfast, lunch, after school snack and supper programs; a la carte venues, including snack bars and school stores; vending machines; fundraisers; and classroom parties and celebrations. Study staff implemented the intervention using core and toolbox strategies to achieve and maintain the following five intervention goals: (1) lower the average fat content of foods, (2) increase the availability and variety of fruits and vegetables, (3) limit the portion sizes and energy content of dessert and snack foods, (4) eliminate whole and 2% milk and all added sugar beverages, with the exception of low fat or nonfat flavored milk, and limit 100% fruit juice to breakfast in small portions and (5) increase the availability of higher fiber grain-based foods and legumes. Other nutrition intervention component elements were taste tests, cafeteria enhancements, cafeteria line messages and other messages about healthy eating, cafeteria learning laboratory (CLL) activities, twice-yearly training of food service staff, weekly meetings with food service managers, incentives for food service departments, and twice yearly local meetings and three national summits with district food service directors. Strengths of the intervention design were the integration of nutrition with the other HEALTHY intervention components (physical education, behavior change and communications), and the collaboration and rapport between the nutrition intervention study staff members and food service personnel at both school and district levels.</fragment>

				<fragment>HEALTHY was a 3-year middle school-based primary prevention trial to reduce modifiable risk factors for type 2 diabetes in youth. The study was conducted at seven centers across the country. This paper describes the recruitment and retention activities employed in the study. Schools and students were the focus of recruitment and retention. Each center was responsible for the recruitment of six schools; eligibility was based on ability to enroll a sufficient number of predominately minority and lower socioeconomic status students. Study staff met with district superintendents and school principals to verify the eligibility of schools, and to ascertain how appropriate the school would be for conducting the trial. Sixth grade students were recruited employing a variety of techniques; students and their parents did not know whether their school was randomized to the intervention or control arm. This cohort was followed through sixth, seventh and eighth grades. In the eighth grade, an additional sample of students who were not originally enrolled in the study was recruited in a similar manner to participate in data collection to allow for cross-sectional and dose-response secondary analyses. Parents signed informed consent forms and children signed informed assent forms, as per the needs of the local Institutional Review Board. Parents received a letter describing the results of the health screening for their children after data collection in sixth and eighth grades. Retention of schools and students was critical for the success of the study and was encouraged through the use of financial incentives and other strategies. To a large extent, student withdrawal due to out-migration (transfer and geographical relocation) was beyond the ability of the study to control. A multi-level approach that proactively addressed school and parent concerns was crucial for the success of recruitment and retention in the HEALTHY study.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>The results of the Sarpogrelate-Aspirin Comparative Clinical Study for Efficacy and Safety in Secondary Prevention of Cerebral Infarction (S-ACCESS), a randomized double-blind study of sarpogrelate (selective 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist) versus aspirin in 1510 Japanese patients, have been reported. But S-ACCESS failed to demonstrate noninferiority of sarpogrelate to aspirin for preventing the recurrence of cerebral infarction. Here we compare the characteristics of sarpogrelate and aspirin in various subgroups.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Despite previous reports of potential adverse cardiovascular effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists, the promise for PPAR agonists to positively affect risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes is of continued interest. The SYNCHRONY study aimed to establish the glucose-lowering and lipid-modifying effects, and safety profile, of the dual PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma agonist aleglitazar.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In this double-blind study, patients with type 2 diabetes (either drug-naive or pre-treated with &lt;/=two oral agents) were enrolled from 47 sites in seven countries. After a single-blind, 4-5-week placebo run-in period, 332 patients were randomised double-blind (via an interactive voice-response system) to 16 weeks' treatment with aleglitazar at once-daily doses of 50 mug, 150 mug, 300 mug, or 600 mug, or matching placebo (n=55 in each group), or to open-label pioglitazone 45 mg once daily (n=57) as a reference. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) concentration from baseline to the end of treatment. Patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one evaluable post-baseline HbA(1c) measurement were included in the efficacy analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00388518.</fragment>

Aleglitazar significantly reduced baseline HbA(1c) versus placebo in a dose-dependent manner, from -0.36% (95% CI 0.00 to -0.70, p=0.048) with 50 mug to -1.35% (-0.99 to -1.70, p&lt;0.0001) with 600 mug. The trend of changes over time suggests that the maximum effect of aleglitazar on HbA(1c) concentration was not yet reached after 16 weeks of treatment. Oedema, haemodilution, and weight gain occurred in a dose-dependent manner. However, at aleglitazar doses less than 300 mug, no patients had congestive heart failure, frequency of oedema was similar to placebo (one case at 50 mug, two at 150 mug, and three with placebo) and less than with pioglitazone (four cases), and bodyweight gain was less than with pioglitazone (0.52 kg at 150 mug vs 1.06 kg).</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Rosiglitazone is an insulin sensitiser used in combination with metformin, a sulfonylurea, or both, for lowering blood glucose in people with type 2 diabetes.

				<fragment>This analysis included a subset of patients receiving prior OAD monotherapy from 2 phase 3, 26-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-control, parallel-group, multicenter, multinational trials. Prior to randomization, patients not already receiving either metformin or glimepiride were switched to monotherapy with one of these drugs, and the dose was titrated to defined targets. Patients were then randomized to liraglutide (1.8 mg, 1.2 mg, or 0.6 mg once daily), placebo (OAD monotherapy plus placebo), or active comparator (rosiglitazone or glimepiride). For this analysis, only the liraglutide 1.8-mg dose was included. The primary outcome measure was change in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline. Secondary endpoints included in this analysis are percentage of patients achieving HbA1c &lt; 7%, change in fasting plasma glucose, systolic blood pressure, body weight, beta-cell function, hypoglycemic episodes, and nausea.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>There was a significant reduction in HbA1c in patients previously treated with OAD monotherapy (P &lt; 0.0001) and significantly more patients achieved HbA1c &lt; 7% (P = 0.0005) with the addition of liraglutide than with rosiglitazone. In addition, rosiglitazone plus glimepiride was associated with significantly more weight gain (P &lt; 0.0001) than liraglutide plus glimepiride (P = 0.04). For patients on metformin monotherapy, the addition of liraglutide or glimepiride resulted in similar levels of glycemic control; however, patients receiving glimepiride had significantly greater weight gain (P &lt; 0.0001) and higher rates of minor hyperglycemia.</fragment>

		<updated>2009-05-25</updated>
		<summary>Classic markers of macrovascular and microvascular risk were associated with lower extremity amputations in patients with type 2 diabetes. Treatment with fenofibrate was associated with a lower risk of amputations, particularly minor amputations without known large-vessel disease, probably through non-lipid mechanisms. These findings could lead to a change in standard treatment for the prevention of diabetes-related lower-limb amputations.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Amputations in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus substantially impair their quality of life and impose high costs on health-care systems. Our aim was to assess the effect of fenofibrate on amputation events in a large cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study, 9795 patients aged 50-75 years with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned by computer-generated randomisation sequence to receive fenofibrate 200 mg per day (n=4895) or matching placebo (n=4900) for 5 years' duration. Information about non-traumatic amputation-a prespecified tertiary endpoint of the study-was routinely gathered. Clinicians who were masked to treatment allocation adjudicated amputations as minor or major (below or above the ankle, respectively). Amputations were also classified on the basis of whether or not large-vessel disease was present in the limb, to distinguish those related to large-artery atherosclerosis from those predominantly related to microvascular disease. Analysis was by intention to treat (ITT). The FIELD study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN64783481.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>All 9795 patients were included in the ITT population. 115 patients had one or more non-traumatic lower-limb amputations due to diabetes. Previous cardiovascular disease, microvascular disease, previous non-traumatic amputation or skin ulcer, smoking, and longer duration of diabetes were more frequent in patients who had amputations during the trial than in those who had other cardiovascular events or in those who had neither event (all p&lt;0.001 for three-way comparison). Mean lipid concentrations differed between patients who had on-study amputations and those who had other cardiovascular events or neither event, but by no more than 0.2 mmol/L. The risks of first amputation (45 vs 70 events; hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.44-0.94; p=0.02) and minor amputation events without known large-vessel disease (18 vs 34 events; 0.53, 0.30-0.94; p=0.027) were lower for patients assigned to fenofibrate than for patients assigned to placebo, with no difference between groups in risk of major amputations (24 vs 26 events; 0.93, 0.53-1.62; p=0.79).</fragment>

		<content>
			<section>
				<fragment>The objective of this multicenter, randomized, double-blind study was to determine the efficacy and safety of cetilistat and orlistat relative to placebo in obese patients with type 2 diabetes, on metformin. Following a 2-week run-in, patients were randomized to placebo, cetilistat (40, 80, or 120 mg three times daily), or orlistat 120 mg t.i.d., for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was absolute change in body weight from baseline. Secondary endpoints included other measures of obesity and glycemic control. Similar reductions in body weight were observed in patients receiving cetilistat 80 or 120 mg t.i.d. or 120 mg t.i.d. orlistat; these reductions were significant vs. placebo (3.85 kg, P = 0.01; 4.32 kg, P = 0.0002; 3.78 kg, P = 0.008). In the 40 mg t.i.d. and placebo groups, reductions were 2.94 kg, P = 0.958 and 2.86 kg, respectively. Statistically significant reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) were noted. Cetilistat was well tolerated, and showed fewer discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) than in the placebo and orlistat groups. Discontinuation in the orlistat group was significantly worse than in the 120 mg cetilistat and placebo groups and was entirely due to gastrointestinal (GI) AEs. Treatment with cetilistat 80 or 120 mg t.i.d., or with orlistat 120 mg t.i.d., significantly reduced body weight and improved glycemic control relative to placebo in obese diabetic patients. Cetilistat was well tolerated with the number of discontinuations due to AEs being similar to placebo.</fragment>

				<fragment>BP is an important determinant of kidney disease among patients with diabetes. The recommended thresholds to initiate treatment to lower BP are 130/80 and 125/75 mmHg for people with diabetes and nephropathy, respectively. We sought to determine the effects of lowering BP below these currently recommended thresholds on renal outcomes among 11,140 patients who had type 2 diabetes and participated in the Action in Diabetes and Vascular disease: preterAx and diamicroN-MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) study. Patients were randomly assigned to fixed combination perindopril-indapamide or placebo, regardless of their BP at entry. During a mean follow-up of 4.3 yr, active treatment reduced the risk for renal events by 21% (P &lt; 0.0001), which was driven by reduced risks for developing microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria (both P &lt; 0.003). Effects of active treatment were consistent across subgroups defined by baseline systolic or diastolic BP. Lower systolic BP levels during follow-up, even to &lt;110 mmHg, was associated with progressively lower rates of renal events. In conclusion, BP-lowering treatment with perindopril-indapamide administered routinely to individuals with type 2 diabetes provides important renoprotection, even among those with initial BP &lt;120/70 mmHg. We could not identify a BP threshold below which renal benefit is lost.</fragment>

				<fragment>This report provides a further analysis of the first year weight losses in the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) study and identifies factors associated with success. Participants were a total of 5,145 men and women with type 2 diabetes who were recruited at 16 sites and randomly assigned to an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) or a control condition, Diabetes Support and Education (DSE). During year 1, participants in ILI received comprehensive diet and physical activity counseling in a total of 42 group and individual sessions, compared with three educational sessions for DSE participants. As reported previously, at the end of the year, ILI participants lost 8.6% of initial weight, compared to 0.7% for DSE (P &lt; 0.001). Within the ILI group, all racial/ethnic groups achieved clinically significant weight losses (&gt;5.5%), although there were significant differences among groups. For the year, ILI participants attended an average of 35.4 treatment sessions and reported exercising a mean of 136.6 min/week and consuming a total of 360.9 meal replacement products. Greater self-reported physical activity was the strongest correlate of weight loss, followed by treatment attendance and consumption of meal replacements. The use of orlistat, during the second half of the year, increased weight loss only marginally in those ILI participants who had lost &lt;5% of initial weight during the first 6 months and chose to take the medication thereafter as a toolbox option. The lifestyle intervention was clinically effective in all subsets of an ethnically and demographically diverse population.</fragment>

				<fragment>Pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione (TZD) commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes, is associated with weight gain. Our study was designed to examine the effectiveness of three lifestyle-treatment programs of varying intensity on prevention of pioglitazone-induced weight gain and to measure the composition of the change in body weight. Thirty-nine adult overweight and obese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus were all treated with pioglitazone and prospectively randomized to one of three lifestyle-treatment programs with increasing level of intensity for 24 weeks. Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), computed tomography, and multifrequency bioimpedance analysis both before and after therapy. Subjects demonstrated a "dose-response" effectiveness to three levels of lifestyle intervention to mitigate pioglitazone-induced weight gain. Mean (s.d.) weight change (kg) for the usual, standard, and intensive lifestyle groups were 4.9 +/- 4.9 (P = 0.005), 1.8 +/- 3.4 (P = 0.02), and -0.2 +/- 4.4 (NS) respectively. Total body fat increased 2.6 +/- 3.4 kg (P = 0.04) for the usual group and decreased for the intensive group -0.4 +/- 3.5 (NS). Change in abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) did not differ between groups, although ratio of visceral/subcutaneous fat decreased for the standard and intensive groups (NS). Both usual (P &lt; 0.05) and standard care (NS) groups gained total body water. This is the first prospective, randomized study that demonstrates the beneficial effect of participation in a comprehensive lifestyle-weight-management program on lessening of weight gain associated with pioglitazone.</fragment>

				<fragment>The aim of the study was to assess effects of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor vildagliptin on alpha-cell response to hyper- and hypoglycemia.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="DESIGN" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We conducted a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover study of 28-d treatment, with a 4-wk between-period washout. Patients: We studied drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes and baseline glycosylated hemoglobin of 7.5% or less.</fragment>

			<section label="INTERVENTION" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Participants received vildagliptin (100 mg/d) or placebo as outpatients. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We measured the following: 1) change in plasma glucagon levels during hypoglycemic (2.5 mm glucose) clamp; and 2) incremental (Delta) glucagon area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to 60 min (AUC(0-60 min)) during standard meal test. Before the study, it was hypothesized that vildagliptin would suppress glucagon secretion during meal tests and enhance the glucagon response to hypoglycemia.</fragment>

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>The mean change in glucagon during hypoglycemic clamp was 46.7 +/- 6.9 ng/liter with vildagliptin treatment and 33.9 +/- 6.7 ng/liter with placebo; the between-treatment difference was 12.8 +/- 7.0 ng/liter (P = 0.039), representing a 38% increase with vildagliptin. In contrast, the mean glucagon DeltaAUC(0-60 min) during meal test with vildagliptin was 512 +/- 163 ng/liter x min vs. 861 +/- 130 ng/liter x min with placebo; the between-treatment difference was -349 +/- 158 ng/liter x min (P = 0.019), representing a 41% decrease with vildagliptin.</fragment>

			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>The NP sites (n = 4) were randomized to an enhanced standard care program (one NP and one nutrition session) or a lifestyle program (enhanced standard care and six NP sessions).

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>The program reached a diverse, obese, and moderately low income sample. The NPs were able to successfully implement the protocols. The average length of the program was 9.3 months. Attendance was high (98%), and attrition was low (12%). The NPs were able to adopt the educational, behavioral, and psychosocial strategies of the intervention easily. Motivational interviewing was more difficult for NPs. Mixed-model repeated-measures analysis indicated significant trends or improvement in both groups for nutrition and exercise behavior. Participants of the lifestyle program demonstrated trends for better high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and exercise behavior compared with the enhanced standard care participants. Twenty-five percent of lifestyle participants met treatment goals of 5% weight loss compared with 11% of standard care participants.</fragment>

		<content>
			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>The reduced incretin effect in subjects with type 2 diabetes is accompanied by a severely impaired insulinotropic effect of the incretin hormone glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). The K(ATP) channels of the beta-cell appear to be essential for the function of GIP in mice, and mutations in the gene encoding these channels have been linked to the development of type 2 diabetes. With this study we therefore aimed at clarifying the role of K(ATP) channel malfunction in the impaired function of GIP.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>In this single-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study, the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, tolerability, and safety of subcutaneous exenatide were evaluated in 40 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients were allocated to 4 groups and randomized to receive exenatide (n = 8/group) or placebo (n = 2/group), with all receiving placebo on day 1. On day 2, patients received single-dose exenatide (2.5 microg [group A] or 5 microg [groups B, C, and D]) or placebo and then bid on days 3 to 5. On days 6 to 10, groups A and B continued on 2.5 and 5 microg bid; groups C and D received 10 and 15 microg bid, respectively. The last dose was given on the morning of day 10. All adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Exenatide was generally well tolerated up to 10 microg. Exenatide was well absorbed with a median t(max) of 1.5 hours and mean t((1/2)) of 1.6 hours; exposure increased with dose. Up to 10 microg, exenatide reduced postprandial glucose concentrations in a dose-dependent fashion compared with placebo; decreases were similar for 10 and 15 microg. An E(max) model demonstrated that doses higher than 2.5 microg were necessary for adequate glycemic response. Based on tolerability and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships, 5 and 10 microg exenatide may be considered for further clinical development in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.</fragment>

			<section label="CONTEXT" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Insulin resistance is an important feature of type 2 diabetes. Ectoenzyme nucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) inhibits insulin signaling, and a recent meta-analysis reported a nominal association between the Q allele in the K121Q (rs1044498) single nucleotide polymorphism in its gene ENPP1 and type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE AND INTERVENTION: We examined the impact of this polymorphism on diabetes incidence as well as insulin secretion and sensitivity at baseline and after treatment with a lifestyle intervention or metformin vs. placebo in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND OUTCOME: We genotyped ENPP1 K121Q in 3548 DPP participants and performed Cox regression analyses using genotype, intervention, and interactions as predictors of diabetes incidence.</fragment>

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin were higher in QQ homozygotes at baseline (P &lt; 0.001 for both). There was a significant interaction between genotype at rs1044498 and intervention under the dominant model (P = 0.03). In analyses stratified by treatment arm, a positive association with diabetes incidence was found in Q allele carriers compared to KK homozygotes [hazard ratio (HR), 1.38; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08-1.76; P = 0.009] in the placebo arm (n = 996). Lifestyle modification eliminated this increased risk. These findings persisted after adjustment for body mass index and race/ethnicity. Association of ENPP1 K121Q genotype with diabetes incidence under the additive and recessive genetic models showed consistent trends [HR, 1.10 (95% CI, 0.99-1.23), P = 0.08; and HR, 1.16 (95% CI, 0.92-1.45), P = 0.20, respectively] but did not reach statistical significance.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>We investigated the effects of continuous ingestion of a catechin-rich beverage in patients with type 2 diabetes who were not receiving insulin (Ins) therapy in a double-blind controlled study. The participants ingested green tea containing either 582.8 mg of catechins (catechin group; n = 23) or 96.3 mg of catechins (control group; n = 20) per day for 12 weeks. At week 12, the decrease in waist circumference was significantly greater in the catechin group than in the control group. Adiponectin, which is negatively correlated with visceral adiposity, increased significantly only in the catechin group. Although the increase in Ins at week 12 was significantly greater in the catechin group than in the control group, no apparent difference was noted between the two groups in glucose and hemoglobin A(1c). In patients treated with insulinotropic agents, the increase in Ins at week 12 was significantly greater in the catechin group than in the control group. This significant increase in Ins levels was observed only in the catechin group. In the catechin group receiving other treatments, Ins levels remained unchanged. In addition, in patients treated with insulinotropic agents, the decrease in hemoglobin A(1c) at week 12 was significantly greater in the catechin group than in the control group. These results suggest that a catechin-rich beverage might have several therapeutic uses: in the prevention of obesity; in the recovery of Ins-secretory ability; and, as a way to maintain low hemoglobin A(1c) levels in type 2 diabetic patients who do not yet require Ins therapy.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>We have reported that the sequence variation in the tenomodulin (TNMD) gene is associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), central obesity and serum levels of systemic immune mediators in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS), which is a longitudinal lifestyle intervention study on 522 middle-aged persons with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). The aim of this study was to investigate whether the association with T2DM, observed in the DPS could be replicated in a larger, cross-sectional population-based random sample of 5298 men (3020 with normoglycaemia, 984 with impaired fasting glucose, 436 with IGT and 811 with T2DM) from the region of Kuopio, eastern Finland. To further explore the putative mechanisms linking TNMD to T2DM and metabolic syndrome, we studied the associations of TNMD sequence variation with lipid abnormalities characteristic to metabolic syndrome. The association with T2DM risk was not replicated, but significant associations were found with serum low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol in a body mass index-dependent manner. These associations were also observed in the men of DPS, whereas in women these associations were not significant. These results from two independent study populations suggest that the genetic variation in TNMD could modulate cholesterol metabolism in obese men.</fragment>

		<summary>Vildagliptin improves islet function in T2DM under fasting conditions. This suggests that DPP-4 inhibition has metabolic benefits in addition to enhancing meal-induced GLP-1 and GIP activity.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="CONTEXT" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are proposed to lower blood glucose in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by prolonging the activity of the circulating incretins, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). Consistent with this mechanism of action, DPP-4 inhibitors improve glucose tolerance after meals by increasing insulin and reducing glucagon levels in the plasma. However, DPP-4 inhibitors also reduce fasting blood glucose, an unexpected effect because circulating levels of active GIP and GLP-1 are low in the postabsorptive state. Objective: The objective of the study was to examine the effects of DPP-4 inhibition on fasting islet function.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="DESIGN" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Setting: The study was performed in General Clinical Research Centers at two University Hospitals.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="SUBJECTS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Forty-one subjects with T2DM were treated with metformin or diet, having good glycemic control with glycosylated hemoglobin values of 6.2-7.5%. Intervention: Subjects were treated with vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) or placebo for 3 months, followed by a 2-wk washout. Major Outcome Measure: We measured insulin secretion in response to iv glucose and arginine before and after treatment and after drug washout.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>There were small and comparable reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin in both groups over 3 months. Vildagliptin increased fasting GLP-1 levels in subjects taking metformin, but not those managed with diet, and raised active GIP levels slightly. DPP-4 inhibitor treatment improved the acute insulin and C-peptide responses to glucose (50 and 100% respectively; P &lt; 0.05) and increased the slope of the C-peptide response to glucose (33%; P = 0.023).</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Diabetic retinopathy remains a leading cause of visual loss in people of working age. We examined whether candesartan treatment could slow the progression and, secondly, induce regression of retinopathy in people with type 2 diabetes.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We did a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial in 309 centres worldwide. We recruited normoalbuminuric, normotensive, or treated hypertensive people with type 2 diabetes with mild to moderately severe retinopathy and assigned them to candesartan 16 mg once a day or placebo. After a month, the dose was doubled to 32 mg once per day. Investigators and patients were unaware of the treatment allocation status. Progression of retinopathy was the primary endpoint, and regression was a secondary endpoint. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00252694.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>1905 participants (aged 37-75 years) were randomised to candesartan (n=951) or placebo (n=954). 161 (17%) patients in the candesartan group and 182 (19%) in the placebo group had progression of retinopathy by three steps or more on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study scale. The risk of progression of retinopathy was non-significantly reduced by 13% in patients on candesartan compared with those on placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.87, 95% CI 0.70-1.08, p=0.20). Regression on active treatment was increased by 34% (1.34, 1.08-1.68, p=0.009). HRs were not attenuated by adjustment for baseline risk factors or changes in blood pressure during the trial. An overall change towards less severe retinopathy by the end of the trial was observed in the candesartan group (odds 1.17, 95% CI 1.05-1.30, p=0.003). Adverse events did not differ between the treatment groups.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>Statins have multiple effects, including anti-inflammatory actions, lowering C-reactive protein levels, and reducing coronary events. We performed a post hoc analysis of the randomized placebo-controlled 4D Study that had evaluated the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin in 1255 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were on maintenance hemodialysis. Here we determined the relationship between atorvastatin treatment, C-reactive protein, and the outcome of patients who had pre-specified and adjudicated endpoints of all-cause mortality, composite vascular endpoint, myocardial infarction, sudden death, and stroke. Atorvastatin had no significant effect on the risk of composite vascular endpoint or death relative to placebo in any quartile of baseline C-reactive protein. These baseline levels were not significantly different between the treated and placebo group and remained stable at 6 months on atorvastatin but significantly increased in those patients on placebo. All of the patients with baseline C-reactive protein in the fourth quartile had a significantly increased risk of deaths and in composite vascular endpoint compared to patients in the first quartile. The mean value of two consecutive C-reactive protein measurements was associated with significant increases in the risk of sudden death, stroke, all-cause mortality and composite vascular endpoint. Our results show that C-reactive protein was highly predictive of outcome, but atorvastatin treatment was not associated with reduced relative risks in the composite vascular endpoint or mortality in patients on hemodialysis with or without inflammation.</fragment>

			<section label="OBJECTIVES" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Our aim was to investigate if the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonist pioglitazone modulates inflammation through PPARalpha mechanisms.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>The thiazolidinediones (TZDs) pioglitazone and rosiglitazone are insulin-sensitizing PPARgamma agonists used to treat type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Despite evidence for TZDs limiting inflammation and atherosclerosis, questions exist regarding differential responses to TZDs. In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled 16-week trial among recently diagnosed T2DM subjects (n = 34), pioglitazone-treated subjects manifested lower triglycerides and lacked the increase in soluble vascular cell adhesion molecules (sVCAM)-1 evident in the placebo group. Previously we reported PPARalpha but not PPARgamma agonists could repress VCAM-1 expression. Since both triglyceride-lowering and VCAM-1 repression characterize PPARalpha activation, we studied pioglitazone's effects via PPARalpha.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Pioglitazone effects on known PPARalpha responses--ligand binding domain activation and PPARalpha target gene expression--were tested in vitro and in vivo, including in wild-type and PPARalpha-deficient cells and mice, and compared with the effects of other PPARgamma (rosiglitazone) and PPARalpha (WY14643) agonists.</fragment>

				<fragment>Pioglitazone repressed endothelial TNFalpha-induced VCAM-1 messenger ribonucleic acid expression and promoter activity, and induced hepatic IkappaBalpha in a manner dependent on both pioglitazone exposure and PPARalpha expression. Pioglitazone also activated the PPARalpha ligand binding domain and induced PPARalpha target gene expression, with in vitro effects that were most pronounced in endothelial cells. In vivo, pioglitazone administration modulated sVCAM-1 levels and IkappaBalpha expression in wild-type but not PPARalpha-deficient mice.</fragment>

				<fragment>A prospective, 16-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted at 50 sites in the United States and 1 site in Mexico between August 12, 2004, and December 28, 2005. Subjects had type 2 diabetes mellitus that was not adequately controlled (glycated hemoglobin level, 7.5%-9.5%, inclusive) receiving insulin therapy alone or in combination with oral antidiabetes agents. In total 287 subjects (52% men; mean age, 57 years; with a mean baseline glycated hemoglobin level of 8.3%) were randomized: 147 to receive colesevelam hydrochloride, 3.75 g/d, and 140 to receive placebo.</fragment>

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Using the least squares method, the mean (SE) change in glycated hemoglobin level from baseline to week 16 was -0.41% (0.07%) for the colesevelam-treated group and 0.09% (0.07%) for the placebo group (treatment difference, -0.50% [0.09%]; 95% confidence interval, -0.68% to -0.32%; P &lt; .001). Consistent reductions in fasting plasma glucose and fructosamine levels, glycemic-control response rate, and lipid control measures were observed with colesevelam. As expected, the colesevelam-treated group had a 12.8% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration relative to placebo (P &lt; .001). Of recipients of colesevelam and placebo, respectively, 30 and 26 discontinued the study prematurely; 7 and 9 withdrew because of protocol-specified hyperglycemia, and 10 and 4 withdrew because of adverse events. Both treatments were generally well tolerated.</fragment>

		<summary>Nocturnal variations of EGP and Rd explain the reduced incidence of hypoglycemia and lower fasting glucose levels reported for insulin glargine compared with human NPH insulin.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="AIMS/HYPOTHESIS" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Insulin glargine is a long-acting human insulin analog often administered at bedtime to patients with type 2 diabetes. It reduces fasting blood glucose levels more efficiently and with less nocturnal hypoglycemic events compared with human neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin. Therefore, bedtime injections of insulin glargine and NPH insulin were compared overnight and in the morning.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In 10 type 2 diabetic patients, euglycemic clamps were performed, including [6,6'](2)H(2) glucose, to study the rate of disappearance (Rd) and endogenous production (EGP) of glucose during the night. On separate days at bedtime (2200 h), patients received a sc injection of insulin glargine, NPH insulin, or saline in a randomized, double-blind fashion.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Similar doses of both insulins had different metabolic profiles. NPH insulin had a greater effect on both Rd and EGP in the night compared with insulin glargine. By contrast, in the morning, insulin glargine was more effective, increasing Rd by 5.8 micromol/kg(-1).min(-1) (95% confidence interval 4.7-6.9) and reducing EGP -5.7 (-5.0 to -6.4) compared with NPH insulin. Nearly 80% of the glucose lowering effect in the morning was due to insulin glargine's reduction of EGP. Its injection was associated with one-third lower morning glucagon levels compared with NPH insulin (P = 0.021).</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>Poor adjustment to diabetes in older African American women may result from uncertainty, stemming from a lack of information about self-care activities, a complexity of self-care activities, comorbid conditions, and a lack of resources. This study evaluated a telephone intervention to reduce uncertainty (through problem-solving strategies, information, cognitive reframing, and improved patient-provider communication)--namely, to measure its effects on diabetes self-care and psychosocial adjustment. Sixty-eight older African American women were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group received the intervention for 4 weeks, and the control group received usual care. Psychosocial adjustment and self-care were measured in all participants at baseline and 6 weeks postbaseline. The experimental group reported increased participation in exercise (self-care component; p &lt; .001) and improvement in psychosocial adjustment (p &lt; .001). Thus, reducing the uncertainty related to diabetes self-care improves self-care exercise, as well as psychosocial adjustment.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>Intensification of glycemic control is associated with weight gain, however, less is known about weight change during the maintenance phase of glycemic management. On the basis of current models of energy homeostasis, we hypothesize that insulin use will result in less weight gain than oral antidiabetic agents in patients with well-controlled diabetes. This is a prospective cohort nested within a randomized control trial at an academic clinic, with enrollment from June 2002 to January 2005. A total of 163 patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled after obtaining glycemic control. Insulin use was assessed by self-report at baseline. Participants were weighed at baseline and five follow-up visits over 24 months. The weight change was compared between insulin users and noninsulin users. The average (s.d.) age was 55 (11), 44% are female and 21% are black. The median duration of diabetes was 5 (0.5-10) years. At baseline, 88 participants (54%) reported insulin use with an average of 69 (6) units/day. Baseline BMI in the insulin users was 35 (6) and 33 (6) in noninsulin patients. Over 24 months, noninsulin patients gained 2.3 additional kilograms compared with insulin users (2.8 kg (6.8) vs. 0.5 kg (6.5), P = 0.065). After adjusting for age, race, sex, baseline weight, intervention status, and change in A1C, insulin users had 2.5 kg less weight gain than noninsulin users (P = 0.033). Less weight gain was observed over 24 months in insulin-treated patients. Whether this effect may be due to central catabolic effects of insulin merits additional confirmatory study and mechanistic investigation.</fragment>

We evaluated the renoprotective effects of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by adding treatment with aliskiren, an oral direct renin inhibitor, to treatment with the maximal recommended dose of losartan (100 mg daily) and optimal antihypertensive therapy in patients who had hypertension and type 2 diabetes with nephropathy.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We enrolled 599 patients in this multinational, randomized, double-blind study. After a 3-month, open-label, run-in period during which patients received 100 mg of losartan daily, patients were randomly assigned to receive 6 months of treatment with aliskiren (150 mg daily for 3 months, followed by an increase in dosage to 300 mg daily for another 3 months) or placebo, in addition to losartan. The primary outcome was a reduction in the ratio of albumin to creatinine, as measured in an early-morning urine sample, at 6 months.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>The baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar. Treatment with 300 mg of aliskiren daily, as compared with placebo, reduced the mean urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio by 20% (95% confidence interval, 9 to 30; P&lt;0.001), with a reduction of 50% or more in 24.7% of the patients who received aliskiren as compared with 12.5% of those who received placebo (P&lt;0.001). A small difference in blood pressure was seen between the treatment groups by the end of the study period (systolic, 2 mm Hg lower [P=0.07] and diastolic, 1 mm Hg lower [P=0.08] in the aliskiren group). The total numbers of adverse and serious adverse events were similar in the groups.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="CONCLUSIONS" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>Aliskiren may have renoprotective effects that are independent of its blood-pressure-lowering effect in patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and nephropathy who are receiving the recommended renoprotective treatment.

				<fragment>Even in fully medicated diabetic patients, overall prognosis is unfavorable due to deteriorated cardiovascular function. Based on epidemiological data, diets rich in flavanols are associated with a reduced cardiovascular risk.</fragment>

			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In a feasibility study with 10 diabetic patients, we assessed vascular function as flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, plasma levels of flavanol metabolites, and tolerability after an acute, single-dose ingestion of cocoa, containing increasing concentrations of flavanols (75, 371, and 963 mg). In a subsequent efficacy study, changes in vascular function in 41 medicated diabetic patients were assessed after a 30-day, thrice-daily dietary intervention with either flavanol-rich cocoa (321 mg flavanols per dose) or a nutrient-matched control (25 mg flavanols per dose). Both studies were undertaken in a randomized, double-masked fashion. Primary and secondary outcome measures included changes in FMD and plasma flavanol metabolites, respectively.</fragment>

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>A single ingestion of flavanol-containing cocoa was dose-dependently associated with significant acute increases in circulating flavanols and FMD (at 2 h: from 3.7 +/- 0.2% to 5.5 +/- 0.4%, p &lt; 0.001). A 30-day, thrice-daily consumption of flavanol-containing cocoa increased baseline FMD by 30% (p &lt; 0.0001), while acute increases of FMD upon ingestion of flavanol-containing cocoa continued to be manifest throughout the study. Treatment was well tolerated without evidence of tachyphylaxia. Endothelium-independent responses, blood pressure, heart rate, and glycemic control were unaffected.</fragment>

				<fragment>Delivery of high-quality, evidence-based health care to deprived sectors of the community is a major goal for society. We investigated the effectiveness of a culturally sensitive, enhanced care package in UK general practices for improvement of cardiovascular risk factors in patients of south Asian origin with type 2 diabetes.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In this cluster randomised controlled trial, 21 inner-city practices in the UK were assigned by simple randomisation to intervention (enhanced care including additional time with practice nurse and support from a link worker and diabetes-specialist nurse [nine practices; n=868]) or control (standard care [12 practices; n=618]) groups. All adult patients of south Asian origin with type 2 diabetes were eligible. Prescribing algorithms with clearly defined targets were provided for all practices. Primary outcomes were changes in blood pressure, total cholesterol, and glycaemic control (haemoglobin A1c) after 2 years. Analysis was by intention to treat.

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Oxidative stress and inflammation are involved in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. Our aim was to assess the effects of the antioxidant succinobucol (AGI-1067) on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with recent acute coronary syndromes already managed with conventional treatments.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>After an acute coronary syndrome occurring 14-365 days before recruitment, 6144 patients were randomly assigned with a computer-generated randomisation list, stratified by study site, to receive succinobucol (n=3078) or placebo (n=3066) in addition to standard of care. Enrolment began in July, 2003; this event-driven trial was stopped in August, 2006, after the prespecified number of primary outcome events had occurred. The composite primary endpoint was time to first occurrence of cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, or coronary revascularisation. Efficacy analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00066898.</fragment>

			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>All randomised patients were included in the efficacy analyses. Succinobucol had no effect on the primary endpoint (530 events in succinobucol group vs 529 in placebo group; hazard ratio 1.00, 95% CI 0.89-1.13, p=0.96). The composite secondary endpoint of cardiovascular death, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, or stroke occurred in fewer patients in the succinobucol group than in the placebo group (207 vs 252 events; 0.81, 0.68-0.98, p=0.029). The tertiary endpoint of new-onset diabetes developed in fewer patients without diabetes at baseline in the succinobucol group than in such patients in the placebo group (30 of 1923 vs 82 of 1950 patients; 0.37, 0.24-0.56, p&lt;0.0001). New-onset atrial fibrillation occurred more often in the succinobucol group than in the placebo group (107 of 2818 vs 55 of 2787 patients; 1.87, 1.67-2.09, p=0.0002). Although the number of patients who reported any treatment emergent adverse event was much the same in the two groups, more patients in the succinobucol group than in the placebo group reported bleeding episodes or anaemia (32 vs 18 and 37 vs ten, respectively) as serious adverse events. Relative to treatment with placebo, succinobucol increased LDL cholesterol and systolic blood pressure, and decreased HDL cholesterol and glycated haemoglobin (p&lt;0.0001 for all).</fragment>

		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Early intensive insulin therapy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes might improve beta-cell function and result in extended glycaemic remissions. We did a multicentre, randomised trial to compare the effects of transient intensive insulin therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII] or multiple daily insulin injections [MDI]) with oral hypoglycaemic agents on beta-cell function and diabetes remission rate.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>382 patients, aged 25-70 years, were enrolled from nine centres in China between September, 2004, and October, 2006. The patients, with fasting plasma glucose of 7.0-16.7 mmol/L, were randomly assigned to therapy with insulin (CSII or MDI) or oral hypoglycaemic agents for initial rapid correction of hyperglycaemia. Treatment was stopped after normoglycaemia was maintained for 2 weeks. Patients were then followed-up on diet and exercise alone. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests were done and blood glucose, insulin, and proinsulin were measured before and after therapy withdrawal and at 1-year follow-up. Primary endpoint was time of glycaemic remission and remission rate at 1 year after short-term intensive therapy. Analysis was per protocol. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00147836.</fragment>

			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>More patients achieved target glycaemic control in the insulin groups (97.1% [133 of 137] in CSII and 95.2% [118 of 124] in MDI) in less time (4.0 days [SD 2.5] in CSII and 5.6 days [SD 3.8] in MDI) than those treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents (83.5% [101 of 121] and 9.3 days [SD 5.3]). Remission rates after 1 year were significantly higher in the insulin groups (51.1% in CSII and 44.9% in MDI) than in the oral hypoglycaemic agents group (26.7%; p=0.0012). beta-cell function represented by HOMA B and acute insulin response improved significantly after intensive interventions. The increase in acute insulin response was sustained in the insulin groups but significantly declined in the oral hypoglycaemic agents group at 1 year in all patients in the remission group.</fragment>

		<summary>A therapeutic regimen involving the addition of either basal or prandial insulin analogue is equally effective in lowering haemoglobin A(1c).

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>As type 2 diabetes mellitus progresses, oral hypoglycaemic agents often fail to maintain blood glucose control and insulin is needed. We investigated whether the addition of once-daily insulin glargine is non-inferior to three-times daily prandial insulin lispro in overall glycaemic control in adults with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus taking oral hypoglycaemic agents.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In the 44-week, parallel, open study that was undertaken in 69 study sites across Europe and Australia, 418 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus that was inadequately controlled by oral hypoglycaemic agents were randomly assigned to either insulin glargine taken once daily at the same time every day or to insulin lispro administered three times per day. The primary objective was to compare the change in haemoglobin A(1c) from baseline to endpoint (week 44) between the two regimens. Randomisation was done with a central randomisation service. Analysis was per protocol. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00311818.</fragment>

For our sample, we: (1) identified characteristics associated with response to interventions or outcomes; (2) summarized feasible partitions of 10 system A practices (2 groups) and 14 system B practices (3 groups) using intra-cluster correlation coefficients (ICCs) and standardized differences; (3) selected (blinded) partitions to effectively balance the characteristics; and (4) randomly assigned groups of practices to interventions.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>In System A, 4,306 patients, were assigned to 2 groups of practices; 8,369 patients in system B were assigned to 3 groups of practices. Nearly all baseline outcome variables and covariates were well-balanced, including several not included in the initial design. DIG-IT's balance was superior to alternative partitions based on volume, geography or demographics alone.</fragment>

			<section label="CONCLUSIONS" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>EMRs facilitated rigorous CRT design by identifying large numbers of patients with diabetes and enabling fair comparisons through preassignment balancing of practice sites. Our methods can be replicated in other settings and for other conditions, enhancing the power of other translational investigations.</fragment>

				<fragment>Clinical practice guidelines recommend blockers of the renin-angiotensin system alone or in combination with other agents to reduce blood pressure and albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, however, may lower blood pressure but not albuminuria in these patients. Here we tested the hypothesis that combining an ACE inhibitor with either a thiazide diuretic or a calcium channel blocker will cause similar reductions in blood pressure and albuminuria in hypertensive type 2 diabetics. We conducted a double blind randomized controlled trial on 332 hypertensive, albuminuric type 2 diabetic patients treated with benazepril with either amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide for 1 year. The trial employed a non-inferiority design. Both combinations significantly reduced the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio and sitting blood pressure of the entire cohort. The percentage of patients progressing to overt proteinuria was similar for both groups. When we examined patients who had only microalbuminuria and hypertension we found that a larger percentage of the diuretic and ACE inhibitor normalized their albuminuria. We conclude that initial treatment using benzaepril with a diuretic resulted in a greater reduction in albuminuria compared to the group of ACE inhibitor and calcium channel blocker. In contrast, blood pressure reduction, particularly the diastolic component, favored the combination with amilodipine. The dissociation between reductions in blood pressure and albuminuria may be related to factors other than blood pressure.</fragment>

				<fragment>Losartan treatment reduced renal outcomes in proteinuric patients with type 2 diabetes in the Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) study. It is unknown whether an insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism in the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) gene predicts renal outcomes and death and influences the effect of losartan in these patients. Pharmacogenetic analyses were performed comparing losartan with placebo administered with conventional blood pressure-lowering therapy in 1435 (95%) of the 1513 RENAAL study patients. The primary endpoint was the composite of doubling of baseline serum creatinine concentration, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or death. Cox regression models were stratified on baseline proteinuria and included treatment, geographic region, ACE/ID genotype, and treatment x genotype interaction. Within the placebo group, subjects with the ID or DD genotype were more likely than those with the II genotype to reach the composite endpoint (by 17.5% and 38.1%, respectively, P = 0.029) or its individual components. Within the losartan group, genotype did not correlate with reaching the composite endpoint. Compared with placebo, however, losartan reduced the risk of reaching the composite endpoint by 5.8% (95% confidence interval, -23.3, 28.0), 17.6% (3.8, 29.4), and 27.9% (7.0, 44.1) among those with the II, ID, and DD genotypes, respectively. Similar trends were demonstrated for the individual endpoints. In conclusion, proteinuric type 2 diabetic patients with the D allele of the ACE gene have an unfavorable renal prognosis, which can be mitigated and even improved by losartan.</fragment>

				<fragment>Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers can decrease hemoglobin, causing anemia and this may be an independent risk factor for chronic kidney disease progression. We studied the relationship between a decline in hemoglobin and outcome in 1513 patients with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease by a post hoc analysis of the RENAAL Study (Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan) with an average follow-up of 3.4 years. The relationship between baseline and year-1 hemoglobin and treatment on end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and ESRD or death was evaluated using multivariate Cox models (covariates: baseline hemoglobin, proteinuria, serum albumin, serum creatinine, and year-1 hemoglobin). Compared with placebo, losartan treatment was associated with a significant decrease of hemoglobin, with the largest between-group difference at 1 year. After adjustment, there were significant relative risk reductions for losartan compared with placebo for ESRD and for ESRD or death regardless of the baseline hemoglobin even in those patients with a baseline hemoglobin below 120 g l(-1). Hence, the renoprotective properties of losartan were maintained despite a significant lowering of the hemoglobin concentration.</fragment>

		<summary>The current study indicates that vertical relationships, learning by compliance and external control seem to limit patients' ability to take responsibility for their disease, while horizontal relationships, participatory learning and self-control may contribute to strengthening patients' ability to influence and be actively involved in their own care.</summary>

			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>The aim of the current study was to explore patients' experiences of participating in an empowerment group education programme or receiving individual counselling.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHOD" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In total, 28 patients from seven primary care centres were interviewed. Of these, 14 had received individual counselling and the remaining 14 had also participated in 4-5 empowerment group sessions. The semi-structured interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using qualitative content analysis.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="FINDINGS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Three main categories crystallized from the interviews: (I) relationships, (II) learning and (III) controlling the disease. The relationships in the individual counselling seemed vertical, characterized by one-way communication with care providers acting as superiors and patients as subordinates. The relationships in the empowerment group appeared to be horizontal, characterized by trust and mutual communication. Those who had received individual counselling talked about learning by compliance--care providers acted as superiors, giving advice they expected the patients to follow. In the empowerment groups the patients talked more about participatory learning, whereby the facilitators and patients shared their knowledge and experiences. Controlling the disease could be labelled external in individual counselling, which made it difficult for patients to take responsibility for and control of their diabetes self-care. On the contrary, the patients in the empowerment group achieved the insight that diabetes is a serious disease but can be influenced, which contributed to their experience of self-control.</fragment>

		<content>
			<section>
				<fragment>Participants who received Pies Sanos, a 15-min intervention designed to improve diabetes self-efficacy and foot self-care behaviors in adult patients with type 2 diabetes who lived in a predominantly Mexican American community, performed more-complete foot self-care 1 month later in their homes. Recruited when they presented for nonurgent care to the emergency department in two community hospitals near the U.S.-Mexico border, participants were randomized into one of three groups. At follow-up, there was a significant difference in observed foot self-care behaviors between groups, F(2, 135) = 2.99, p &lt; .05, as well as a significant difference within the intervention, t (47) = -4.32, p &lt; .01, and control group, t (46) = -2.06, p &lt; .05, for baseline and follow-up self-reported foot self-care behaviors. Baseline diabetes self-efficacy was significantly and positively correlated with both baseline (r = .335, p &lt; .001) and follow-up ( r = .174, p &lt; .05) foot self-care behaviors.</fragment>
