			<section label="CONTEXT" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Concerns exist regarding the potential development of malignancies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are receiving biologic response modifiers (BRMs).</fragment>

			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>To assess the risk of malignancy in patients with RA enrolled in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of BRMs.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="DATA SOURCES" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Electronic databases, conference proceedings, and websites of regulatory agencies were searched for RCTs evaluating abatacept, adalimumab, anakinra, certolizumab, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, rituximab, and tocilizumab in RA from inception through July 9, 2012.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="STUDY SELECTION" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Independent selection of studies included RCTs that compared the safety of any BRMs used in RA patients with placebo and/or any traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs with a minimum of 24 weeks of follow-up.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="DATA EXTRACTION" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Independent reviewers selected studies and extracted data on quality and outcomes. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each BRM.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Sixty-three RCTs with 29,423 patients were analyzed. No statistically significant increased risk of developing malignancy was observed. Of the 29,423 patients, 211 developed a malignancy during the trial (118 solid tumors, 48 skin cancers, 14 lymphomas, 5 hematologic nonlymphomas, and 26 not specified). The incidence rate for any malignancy during the first year of therapy was very low in the BRM plus methotrexate group (0.77%; 95% CI, 0.65%-0.92%), the BRM monotherapy group (0.64%; 95% CI, 0.42%-0.95%), and the controls (0.66%; 95% CI, 0.52%-0.84%). Anakinra plus methotrexate showed lower odds compared with methotrexate alone (Peto odds ratio, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03-0.45). No statistically significant risk was observed for specific cancer sites, although the Peto odds ratio for lymphoma was 2.1 (95% CI, 0.55-8.4) in patients receiving tumor necrosis factor inhibitors compared with controls.</fragment>

		<content>
			<section label="OBJECTIVES" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is responsible for 50% of the excess mortality for patients with RA. This study aimed to evaluate a novel 8-week cognitive behavioural patient education intervention designed to effect behavioural change with regard to modifiable CVD risk factors in people with RA.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>This was a non-blinded randomized controlled trial with a delayed intervention arm. Participants were randomly assigned to receive the cognitive behavioural education intervention or a control information leaflet at a ratio of 1:1. The primary outcome measure was patient's knowledge of CVD in RA; secondary measures were psychological measures relating to effecting behaviour change, actual behaviour changes and clinical risk factors. Data were collected at baseline, 2 and 6 months.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>A total of 110 participants consented (52 in the intervention group and 58 in the control group) to participate in the study. At 6 months, those in the intervention group had significantly higher knowledge scores (P &lt; 0.001); improved behavioural intentions to increase exercise (P &lt; 0.001), eat a low-fat diet (P = 0.01) and lose weight (P = 0.06); and lower mean diastolic blood pressure by 3.7 mmHg, whereas the control group's mean diastolic blood pressure increased by 0.8 mmHg. There was no difference between the groups on actual behaviours.</fragment>

		<summary>This study revealed a distinct disease pattern of immune response to the pandemic influenza vaccine in inflammatory arthritis patients receiving anti-TNF agents, illustrated by a reduced immunogenicity solely in SpA patients using mAbs. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01151644.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>To evaluate the immunogenicity of the anti-influenza A H1N1/2009 vaccine in RA and spondyloarthritis (SpA) patients receiving distinct classes of anti-TNF agents compared with patients receiving DMARDs and healthy controls.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>One hundred and twenty patients (RA, n = 41; AS, n = 57; PsA, n = 22) on anti-TNF agents (monoclonal, n = 94; soluble receptor, n = 26) were compared with 116 inflammatory arthritis patients under DMARDs and 117 healthy controls. Seroprotection, seroconversion (SC), geometric mean titre, factor increase in geometric mean titre and adverse events were evaluated 21 days after vaccination.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>After immunization, SC rates (58.2% vs 74.3%, P = 0.017) were significantly lower in SpA patients receiving anti-TNF therapy, whereas no difference was observed in RA patients receiving this therapy compared with healthy controls (P = 0.067). SpA patients receiving mAbs (infliximab/adalimumab) had a significantly lower SC rate compared with healthy controls (51.6% vs 74.3%, P = 0.002) or those on DMARDs (51.6% vs 74.7%, P = 0.005), whereas no difference was observed for patients on etanercept (86.7% vs 74.3%, P = 0.091). Further analysis of non-seroconverting and seroconverting SpA patients revealed that the former group had a higher mean age (P = 0.003), a higher frequency of anti-TNF (P = 0.031) and mAbs (P = 0.001) and a lower frequency of MTX (P = 0.028).

			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>The time trade-off is a health-related quality of life instrument that measures valuations for health states (utilities) by asking patients to value their health state anchored on a scale between death (0) and perfect health (1). Dying earlier is not perceived as a realistic worst-case consequence of the disease by RA patients. Of the previous focus groups study on RA patients, five worst-case future scenarios emerged. The aim of this study was to examine which potential worst-case scenario was the most appropriate for RA patients to use in utility calculation.</fragment>

			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In a cross-sectional study of 74 consecutive RA patients visiting the rheumatology outpatient clinic, participants were presented with descriptions of the five worst-case future scenarios. In pairwise comparisons, patients had to choose the scenario that would be the worst to experience. The worst-case future scenario was defined by the scenario that was chosen by a significantly greater proportion of participants than could be expected based on chance (20%).

			<section>
				<fragment>A failure to respond to TNF inhibitors remains a serious concern for patients with RA. Although some patients experience a primary lack of drug efficacy in reducing their symptoms, others fail to maintain an initial response because of acquired drug resistance. While switching to another TNF inhibitor is a common practice for patients who are not responsive to a particular treatment, limited clinical trial data support this strategy. If more than one TNF inhibitor provides inadequate responses and/or similar tolerability issues, switching to a different class of agent may provide a more effective option. Currently four non-TNF inhibitors are approved for use in RA patients-the T-cell co-stimulation inhibitor abatacept, the B-cell-depleting mAb rituximab, the IL-1 receptor blocker anakinra and the IL-6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab. These biologic agents have been studied in large, randomized placebo-controlled trials that demonstrate their efficacy in reducing disease activity in patients failing TNF inhibitor therapy. Results with the majority of these agents suggest that their administration may provide a greater proportion of patients with an effective, evidence-based disease-modifying approach earlier in the course of their disease than switching TNF inhibitors.</fragment>

There were two studies on meditation and one each on autogenic training, healing therapy, progressive muscle relaxation, static magnets and tai chi. None of these trials reported positive comparative effects on pain but some positive effects on patient global assessment were noted at individual time points in the healing therapy and magnet therapy studies. A small number of other outcomes showed comparative improvement in individual trials. There were no reports of major adverse events. Conclusion: The very limited evidence available indicates that for none of the practitioner-based complementary therapies considered here is there good evidence of efficacy or effectiveness in the management of RA.</fragment>

				<fragment>Analysis of the Swedish Farmacotherapy (Swefot) trial at 12 months showed that the addition of an anti-tumour-necrosis-factor agent gave an improved clinical outcome compared with the addition of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in patients with methotrexate-refractory early rheumatoid arthritis. Here we report the 2 year follow-up assessment.</fragment>

			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In this randomised, non-blinded, parallel-group trial, we enrolled adult patients older than 18 years with rheumatoid arthritis and a symptom duration of less than 1 year from 15 rheumatology units in Sweden between December, 2002 and December, 2006. All patients were started on methotrexate. After 3-4 months, those who failed treatment were randomly assigned (1:1) to group A (conventional treatment; additional sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine) or group B (biological treatment; additional infliximab). Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence. We analysed clinical outcomes at months 18 and 24 by the response criteria of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism, and radiographs of patients' hands and feet at months 12 and 24 using the Van der Heijde modification of the Sharp score.

As DAI usage is imperative to uphold current European League Against Rheumatology (EULAR) treatment recommendations, physicians should consider these therapeutic and economic consequences before choosing a particular DAI.</fragment>

			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Certolizumab pegol (CZP) is known to be effective as monotherapy at a dosage of 400  mg every 4 weeks in patients with active RA who have failed DMARDs.

			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Patients with active RA with inadequate response to MTX, on background MTX, were randomized to double-blind treatment with CZP 400  mg or placebo every 4 weeks for 24 weeks (NCT00544154). The primary efficacy end-point was the ACR 20% improvement criteria (ACR20) response rate at Week 24. Other end-points included ACR50 and ACR70 response rates, ACR core components, 28-joint DAS (ESR) with three variables (DAS28-3) and health-related quality-of-life outcomes in addition to safety.</fragment>

		<content>
			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Optimizing therapeutic strategies to induce remission requires an understanding of the initial features predicting remission. Currently no suitable model exists. We aim to develop a remission score using predictors of remission in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We used a dataset from a UK randomized controlled trial that evaluated intensive treatment with conventional combination therapy, to develop a predictive model for 24-month remission. We studied 378 patients in the trial who received 24 months' treatment. Our model was validated using data from a UK observational cohort (Early RA Network, ERAN). A group of 194 patients was followed for 24 months. Remission was defined as 28-joint Disease Activity Score &lt; 2.6. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations between remission and potential baseline predictors.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed age, sex, and tender joint count (TJC) were independently associated with 24-month remission. The multivariate remission score developed using the trial data correctly classified 80% of patients. These findings were replicated using ERAN. The remission score has high specificity (98%) but low sensitivity (13%). Combining data from the trial and ERAN, we also developed a simplified remission score that showed that younger men with a TJC of 5 or lower were most likely to achieve 24-month remission. Remission was least likely in older women with high TJC. Rheumatoid factor, rheumatoid nodules, and radiographic damage did not predict remission.</fragment>

				<fragment>To assess the efficacy and safety profiles of two different rituximab retreatment regimens in patients with RA.</fragment>

			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Four hundred and ninety-three RA patients with an inadequate response to MTX recruited into rituximab Phase II/III studies received further courses of open-label rituximab based on two approaches: (i) treatment to target (TT): patients assessed 24 weeks after each course and retreated if not in remission [DAS in 28 joints based on ESR (DAS-28-ESR) ≥ 2.6]; (ii) treatment as needed (PRN): patients retreated at the physician's discretion ≥24 weeks following the first course and ≥16 weeks following further courses, if both swollen and tender joint counts were ≥8. All courses consisted of i.v. rituximab 2 × 1000 mg 2 weeks apart plus MTX. Observed data were analysed according to treatment strategy.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Multiple courses of rituximab maintained or improved responses irrespective of regimen. TT provided tighter control of disease activity with significantly greater improvements in DAS-28-ESR and lower HAQ-disability index scores vs PRN. TT resulted in significantly more patients achieving major clinical response. PRN resulted in recurrence of disease symptoms between courses, with TT significantly reducing the incidence of RA flares. Despite more frequent retreatment with TT compared with PRN, the rates of serious adverse events and serious infections were comparable between regimens.</fragment>

				<fragment>Continuous passive motion (CPM), though of doubtful value, is yet routinely practiced post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We prospectively distributed 84 patients with TKA to 1 of the 3 standard rehabilitation regimes: no-CPM, 1-day-CPM, and 3-day-CPM. We recorded a unique "Timed up and go" test besides pain, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC), short form-12 (SF-12), range of motion, knee and calf swelling, and wound healing parameters. Our standardized and elaborate measurements preoperatively and on postoperative days 3, 5, 14, 42, and 90 showed no statistically significant difference among the 3 groups in each parameter. We concluded that CPM gives no benefit in immediate functional recovery post-TKA, and in fact, the postoperative knee swelling persisted longer. We have since then discontinued its use in our patients without any untoward effect.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>Given the important role tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) antagonists play in managing rheumatoid arthritis and the concern for safety during longterm therapy, we reviewed the latest evidence regarding longterm risk of infection and malignancy with TNF-α antagonists. Our objective was to provide clinicians with information that can be used to counsel and monitor patients who may be candidates for biologic therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Risk is examined in the context of background infection and malignancy rates in RA. Randomized controlled trial (RCT) data and observational studies summarizing the risk of infection and/or malignancy in RA and specific risks associated with the use of anti-TNF-α biologic agents (adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept) were identified through a PubMed search. Overall, patients with RA appear to have an approximately 2-fold increased risk of serious infection compared to the general population and non-RA controls, irrespective of TNF-α antagonist use. Although data on infection rates with TNF-α antagonist use are contradictory, caution is merited. Recent analyses suggest that the risk of infection is highest within the first year. Regarding malignancy risk, RCT and observational data are also conflicting; how ever, caution is warranted regarding lymphoproliferative cancers in children and adolescents.</fragment>

				<fragment>The aim of the Efficacy and Safety of Etanercept on Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Despite Methotrexate Therapy in Japan (JESMR) study is to compare the efficacy of continuation versus discontinuation of methotrexate (MTX) when starting etanercept (ETN) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In total, 151 patients with active RA who had been taking MTX were randomized to either ETN 25 mg twice a week with 6-8 mg/week MTX (the E+M group), or ETN alone (the E group). The primary endpoint at Week 52 was the radiographic progression assessed by van der Heijde-modified Sharp score.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>The mean progression in total score at Week 52 was not significantly different, statistically, between the E+M group and the E group (0.8 vs 3.6, respectively; p = 0.06). However, a significant difference was observed in radiographic progression between Weeks 24 and 52 (0.3 vs 2.5; p = 0.03), and the mean progression of the erosion score was negative in the E+M group, which was significantly better than the E group at Week 52 (-0.2 vs 1.8; p = 0.02). Clinically, the cumulative probability plot of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)-N values at Week 52 clearly demonstrated a superior response in the E+M group than in the E group. ACR20, 50, and 70 response rates at Week 52 in the E+M group (86.3%, 76.7%, and 50.7%) were significantly greater than those in the E group (63.8%; p = 0.003, 43.5%; p &lt; 0.0001 and 29.0%; p = 0.01, respectively).</fragment>

		<content>
			<section>
				<fragment>Studies of the effects of disclosing stressful experiences among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have yielded inconsistent findings, perhaps due to different disclosure methods--writing or speaking--and various methodological limitations. We randomized adults with RA to a writing (n=88) or speaking (to a recorder) sample (n=93), and within each sample, to either disclosure or 1 of 2 control groups (positive or neutral events), which conducted four 20-minute, at-home sessions. Follow-up evaluations at 1, 3, and 6 months included self-reported, behavioral, physiological, and blinded physician-assessed outcomes. In both writing and speaking samples, the disclosure and control groups were comparably credible, and the linguistic content differed as expected. Covariance analyses at each follow-up point indicated that written disclosure had minimal effects compared with combined controls--only pain was reduced at 1 and 6 months, but no other outcomes improved. Spoken disclosure led to faster walking speed at 3 months, and reduced pain, swollen joints, and physician-rated disease activity at 6 months, but there were no effects on other outcomes. Latent growth curve modeling examined differences in the trajectory of change over follow-up. Written disclosure improved affective pain and walking speed; spoken disclosure showed only a marginal benefit on sensory pain. In both analyses, the few benefits of disclosure occurred relative to both positive and neutral control groups. We conclude that both written and spoken disclosure have modest benefits for patients with RA, particularly at 6 months, but these effects are limited in scope and consistency.</fragment>

				<fragment>Overall, 302 patients were randomized: 76 to placebo, 75 to 30 mg IR, 73 to 60 mg IR, and 78 to 100 mg ER. There were no significant differences in ACR20 responses at Week 12 between SCIO-469 and placebo. Declines in C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate during early treatment did not persist to Week 12 and were not a consequence of decreased SCIO-469 plasma levels. The 60 mg IR regimen showed a dose-limiting toxicity manifested by elevations in alanine aminotransferase. Adverse events were common in all groups (79.7% and 86.7% through 13 and 26 weeks, respectively). Twenty-one patients reported 28 serious adverse events (SAE). SAE were more common with IR SCIO-469 than with placebo (7% vs 4%) but were not reported with ER SCIO-469.</fragment>

			<section label="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>In all regimens tested, SCIO-469 showed no greater efficacy compared to placebo in patients with RA. The transient effect of SCIO-469 on acute-phase reactants suggests a complex role of p38 MAPK in inflammation.</fragment>

				<fragment>Fostamatinib (R788) is being investigated as an add-on therapy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients with inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). This study evaluated the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between R788 and MTX. Sixteen RA subjects on a stable weekly MTX regimen were enrolled and received MTX on days 1 and 8. Twelve subjects received 100 mg of R788 orally, and 4 subjects received a matching placebo twice daily from days 4 to 8 and once daily on days 3 and 9. Blood samples were collected on days 1 and 8 for MTX and 7-hydroxymethotrexate (7-OH-MTX), and days 3 and 9 for R788 and its active metabolite, R406. MTX and 7-OH-MTX pharmacokinetic parameters were similar on days 1 and 8. In the R788 group, the mean day 8 to day 1 ratios (90% confidence intervals) of maximum concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve estimates were 1.01 (0.85-1.20) and 1.12 (0.90-1.40) for MTX and 1.06 (0.82-1.35) and 1.06 (0.83-1.36) for 7-OH-MTX, respectively. Urinary excretion of MTX and 7-OH-MTX was also similar with or without R788, averaging 58% to 69% and 4% to 5% of the MTX dose, respectively. The data suggest that there is no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction of R788 and MTX in RA patients.</fragment>

		<summary/>
		<content>
			<section>
				<fragment>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit cyclooxygenase activity and hence PG production. However, the ability of NSAIDs to ameliorate pain and tenderness does not prevent disease progression in rheumatoid arthritis, a disease whose pathogenesis is linked to the presence of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha. To understand this observation, we have examined the effect of NSAIDs on the production of clinically validated proinflammatory cytokines. We show that a variety of NSAIDs superinduce production of TNF from human peripheral blood monocytes and rheumatoid synovial membrane cultures. A randomized, double-blinded, crossover, placebo-controlled trial in healthy human volunteers also revealed that the NSAID drug celecoxib increased LPS-induced TNF production in whole blood. NSAID-mediated increases in TNF are reversed by either the addition of exogenous PGE(2) or by a PGE(2) EP2 receptor agonist, revealing that PGE(2) signaling via its EP2 receptor provides a valuable mechanism for controlling excess TNF production. Thus, by reducing the level of PGE(2), NSAIDs can increase TNF production and may exacerbate the proinflammatory environment both within the rheumatoid arthritis joint and the systemic environment.</fragment>

				<fragment>Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) tests were performed on 28 patients at 3 timepoints: at baseline on prestudy immediate-release (IR) prednisone, after the 3-month double-blind phase on either IR prednisone or MR prednisone, and after the 9-month open-label extension on MR prednisone. Changes of cortisol were assessed and compared to individual patients' efficacy and safety data.</fragment>

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>The increase (mean, SD) of cortisol plasma concentrations after injection of corticorelin was 5.5 (4.37) μg/dl on IR prednisone at baseline (n = 21) and 5.3 (4.07) μg/dl on MR prednisone at 12 months (n = 22). Numbers of normal/suppressed/no response reactions did not differ among treatments. Switching from IR to MR prednisone did not influence responses, nor did longterm treatment of up to 12 months with MR prednisone. No worsening of adrenal impairment was observed on treatment with nighttime-release prednisone in patients with low responsiveness to CRH testing before the treatment with MR prednisone.</fragment>

			<section label="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>Treatment with nighttime-release prednisone did not change adrenocortical function over 12 months. We presume that chronotherapy with this nighttime-release prednisone may improve the efficacy of longterm low-dose glucocorticoid treatment in patients with RA.</fragment>

				<fragment>We conducted a prospective randomized, controlled trial in 100 patients to compare the postoperative use of wound drains with the use of no drains in patients who underwent unilateral primary total knee arthroplasty to determine differences in blood loss, range of motion, wound healing, complications (deep vein thrombosis, wound infection), and need for blood transfusions. The patients, who underwent surgery between February 2006 and February 2007, were randomly divided into 2 groups of 50 each: group A, treated without a drain, and group B, treated with a drain. The between-group difference in total blood loss was significant: 535 ± 295 mL in group A and 853 ± 331 mL in group B. Group A needed comparatively less blood transfused than group B did. Differences in wound infection, incidence of deep vein thrombosis, and range of motion were not statistically significant between groups. We found no clear advantage to the use of wound drains in unilateral total knee arthroplasty.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>Golimumab is a human immunoglobulin G1κ monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and specificity to tumor necrosis factor-α. The objective of this study was to establish an approach for exposure-response modeling for golimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis using the American College of Rheumatology index of improvement (ACRN) as a measure of change in disease severity. Data were collected from 302 patients in the phase III GO-FORWARD trial who received golimumab or placebo plus methotrexate (background therapy) every 4 weeks through week 52. A latent-variable (unobservable) approach was used with an inhibitory indirect response model to link the placebo (methotrexate) effect and golimumab concentrations to ACRN scores. A model parameterization was proposed to allow deterioration beyond baseline and maintain mechanistic interpretability of the population-based indirect response model. The modeling was conducted using a sequential pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic approach. None of the covariate factors evaluated (demographics, disease characteristics, comorbidities, or concomitant medications) significantly improved the model fits. Likelihood profiling and a bootstrap analysis were used to assess parameter estimation precision, with their suitability discussed. The approach can be readily extended to model other types of clinical (efficacy or safety) scores with either an upper or a lower boundary.</fragment>

		<summary>These results suggest that cartilage collagen formation and degradation are unbalanced when RA is diagnosed. The different associations of collagen II anabolism (PIIANP) and collagen II degradation (CTX-II) with anti-CCP, synovitis, and radiographic progression indicate that at this early stage of RA, cartilage collagen degradation is mainly driven by synovitis, while anti-CCP antibodies may interfere with cartilage regeneration by inhibiting collagen IIA formation.

CTX-II was increased (p &lt; 0.001) and correlated positively with disease activity and radiographic progression, but not with anti-CCP (p = 0.93). The uncoupling index was not superior to CTX-II in predicting radiographic changes.</fragment>

			<section label="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>These results suggest that cartilage collagen formation and degradation are unbalanced when RA is diagnosed. The different associations of collagen II anabolism (PIIANP) and collagen II degradation (CTX-II) with anti-CCP, synovitis, and radiographic progression indicate that at this early stage of RA, cartilage collagen degradation is mainly driven by synovitis, while anti-CCP antibodies may interfere with cartilage regeneration by inhibiting collagen IIA formation.

				<fragment>Relationships may influence adjustment to chronic pain conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We examined how both marital status and marital adjustment were related to pain, physical disability, and psychological disability in 255 adults with RA. Among married participants (n = 158), better marital adjustment (assessed using the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Scale) was correlated with less pain and physical and psychological disability (all P values &lt; .05). Married participants were divided into distressed (n = 44) and nondistressed (n = 114) subgroups and compared with unmarried participants (n = 97). Controlling for demographics and disease severity, unmarried participants had higher affective pain (P = .009) and higher psychological disability (P = .02) than only the nondistressed married participants, but unmarried participants did not differ from distressed married participants. These findings suggest that being married in itself is not associated with better health in RA but that being in a well-adjusted or nondistressed marriage is linked with less pain and better functioning.</fragment>

				<fragment>This study assessed the efficacy and safety of ketoprofen patch compared with placebo in patients who had rheumatoid arthritis and persistent wrist pain. Patients (N = 676)who had achieved systemic disease control with a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug and/or systemic corticosteroid, but still had persistent wrist pain, were randomized to a 2-week course of once-daily treatment with application of a 20-mg ketoprofen patch or a placebo patch to the wrist. The primary efficacy end point was the percent change from baseline to the end of treatment in the intensity of wrist pain scored by each patient on a 100-mm visual analog scale. The mean ± SD percent change on the pain intensity scale was significantly larger in patients treated with ketoprofen than in those receiving placebo (31.2% ± 30.3% [95% confidence interval: 28.0-34.4] vs 25.5% ± 31.2% [95% confidence interval: 22.1-28.8]; P = .020). However, the actual difference of the mean pain intensity scale between the 2 groups was small at the end of treatment. The frequency of adverse events was similar in both groups. The ketoprofen patch was more effective than placebo for relieving persistent local joint pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The patch was also safe and well tolerated during the 2-week treatment period.</fragment>

		<content>
			<section>
				<fragment>This study evaluated the potential pharmacokinetic interaction of pamapimod, a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, and methotrexate (MTX) when administered concomitantly in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); the study also evaluated the pharmacodynamic effects of pamapimod. Twenty-two RA patients on a stable regimen of MTX (10-25 mg/wk; administered on days 1 and 8) were randomized to receive 300 mg of pamapimod (n = 17) or placebo (n = 5) once daily (qd) for 10 days (days 5-14). Blood and urine samples were collected pre- and postdose on days 1 (MTX alone), 7 (pamapimod alone), and 8 (MTX and pamapimod coadministered). No clinically significant changes were observed in plasma exposures and renal clearance of pamapimod, MTX, or their metabolites, whether administered separately or concomitantly. The combination of pamapimod (300 mg qd) for 10 days and weekly MTX was generally well tolerated. Parameters of RA disease--namely, tender joint count, swollen joint count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein--generally decreased between days 5 and 14. The results of this study suggest that dose adjustments for either drug are not necessary when concomitantly administered and that pamapimod can decrease pharmacodynamic markers of disease activity.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>Tocilizumab is a humanized anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor monoclonal antibody that has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A population pharmacokinetic (PK) model was developed using nonlinear mixed effect modeling to describe the PK profile of tocilizumab and used to estimate interindividual variability and assess the influence of covariates on PK parameters. The model was constructed based on data collected from 1793 patients with moderate to severe RA who received tocilizumab (4 or 8 mg/kg), via intravenous infusion every 4 weeks, during 4 phase III clinical trials. Serum concentration-time profiles of tocilizumab were adequately described by a 2-compartment disposition model with parallel linear and nonlinear elimination kinetics. The 8-mg/kg dose of tocilizumab, compared with the 4-mg/kg dose, resulted in a more pronounced saturation of the nonlinear clearance pathway over the dosing interval, and this nonlinear clearance was representative of target-mediated elimination due to tocilizumab binding to the IL-6 receptor.</fragment>

				<fragment>CP-690,550, a selective inhibitor of the Janus kinase family, is being developed as an oral disease-modifying antirheumatic drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A semi-mechanistic model was developed to characterize the time course of drug-induced absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reduction in a phase 2a study. Data from 264 RA patients receiving 6-week treatment (placebo, 5, 15, 30 mg bid) followed by a 6-week off-treatment period were analyzed. The model included a progenitor cell pool, a maturation chain comprising transit compartments, a circulation pool, and a feedback mechanism. The model was adequately described by system parameters (BASE(h), ktr(h), gamma, and k(circ)), disease effect parameters (DIS), and drug effect parameters (k(off) and k(D)). The disease manifested as an increase in baseline ANC and reduced maturation time due to increased demand from the inflammation site. The drug restored the perturbed system parameters to their normal values via an indirect mechanism. ANC reduction due to a direct myelosuppressive drug effect was not supported. The final model successfully described the dose- and time-dependent changes in ANC and predicted the incidence of neutropenia at different doses reasonably well.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>The authors designed 2 randomized controlled studies to examine the effects of etoricoxib 60 to 120 mg daily on methotrexate pharmacokinetics in 50 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients on stable doses of methotrexate (7.5-20 mg). Patients received oral methotrexate at baseline and on days 7 and 14. In study 1, patients received etoricoxib 60 mg (days 1-7) and then 120 mg (days 8-14); in study 2, patients received etoricoxib 90 mg (days 1-7) and then 120 mg (days 8-14). For study 1, the AUC(0-infinity) geometric mean ratio (GMR) (90% confidence interval [CI]) for day 7 versus baseline was 1.01 (0.91, 1.12) for etoricoxib 60 mg; the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) GMR (90% CI) for day 14 was 1.28 (1.15, 1.42) for etoricoxib 120 mg. For study 2, the AUC(0-infinity) GMR (90% CI) for day 7 versus baseline was 1.07 (1.01, 1.13) for etoricoxib 90 mg; the AUC(0-infinity) GMR (90% CI) for day 14 was 1.05 (0.99, 1.11) for etoricoxib 120 mg. In summary, etoricoxib 60 and 90 mg had no effect on methotrexate plasma concentrations. Although no effect on methotrexate pharmacokinetics was observed with etoricoxib 120 mg in study 2, GMR AUC(0-infinity) fell outside the prespecified bounds in study 1. Standard monitoring of methotrexate-related toxicity should be continued when etoricoxib and methotrexate are administered concurrently, especially with doses &gt;90 mg etoricoxib.</fragment>

				<fragment>New treatment strategies for early rheumatoid arthritis are evolving rapidly.

			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We undertook a randomised trial in 15 rheumatology units in Sweden. We enrolled patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (symptom duration &lt;1 year) and administered methotrexate (up to 20 mg per week). After 3-4 months, those who had not achieved low disease activity but who could tolerate methotrexate were randomly allocated by computer addition of either sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine or infliximab. Primary outcome was achievement of a good response according to European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria at 12 months. Patients were followed up to 24 months; here, we present findings at 12 months. Analysis was by intention to treat and we used non-responder imputation.

			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>461 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis from 82 sites in 10 countries were randomly allocated by interactive voice response system, stratified by study site and methotrexate use, to receive subcutaneous injections of placebo (n=155), 50 mg golimumab (n=153), or 100 mg golimumab (n=153) every 4 weeks between Feb 21, 2006, and Sept 26, 2007. Allocation was double-blind. Eligible patients had been treated with at least one dose of a TNFalpha inhibitor previously. Patients continued stable doses of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, oral corticosteroids, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The primary endpoint was achievement at week 14 of 20% or higher improvement in American College of Rheumatology criteria for assessment of rheumatoid arthritis (ACR20). At week 16, patients who had less than 20% improvement in tender and swollen joint counts were given rescue therapy and changed treatment from placebo to 50 mg golimumab, or from 50 mg to 100 mg golimumab.

Larger magnitudes of decrease in all biomarkers were observed for clinical responders versus nonresponders. For golimumab + MTX, regression analyses including all biomarkers and select clinical measures showed that reductions in levels of several markers (SAA, E-selectin, MMP-9) as early as Week 4 correlated significantly with improvement in swollen joint count (SJC) at Week 16, as did reductions in E-selectin with improvement in tender joint count at Week 16. After accounting for the biomarkers, however, treatment group was no longer significant for SJC.</fragment>

			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Eighty-eight post-menopausal RA patients were randomized to receive vitamin D3 and calcium supplementation with or without HRT (oestradiol plus noretisterone acetate).

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Patients receiving HRT displayed significantly decreased levels of serum sRAGE at 1 and 2 years as compared with levels at study entry. The increase in serum oestradiol was associated with the decline in sRAGE levels. Importantly, sRAGE levels at baseline significantly correlated with bone/cartilage turnover markers including C-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen, carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, and the decrease of sRAGE levels paralleled with diminished concentration of these molecules. BMD in hip and femoral neck and progression of Larsen score at 1 year were associated with baseline sRAGE levels. The decline in sRAGE levels significantly correlated with an increase in total BMD following 2 years of treatment in patients receiving HRT but not in the control group.</fragment>

			</section>
			<section label="DESIGN" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Twenty-three postmenopausal women with primary Sjogren's syndrome and subnormal levels of DHEA-S were included in a randomized, 9-month, controlled, double blind crossover study.

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Baseline erythrocyte sedimentation rate was inversely correlated with testosterone (Testo), dihydrotestosterone, and DHEA-S (rs = -0.42, -0.45, and -0.58, respectively). Dry mouth symptoms correlated with low Testo and androstenedione, whereas dry eyes correlated with low estrogens, most strongly estrone (rs = -0.63). Presence of anti-SS-A and/or anti-SS-B was independently associated with low estradiol (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.82). All metabolites increased during DHEA but not during placebo. The relative increases were less for estrogens and Testo compared to dihydrotestosterone and glucuronidated androgen metabolites.

			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Patients matched on the principal medico-social parameters were randomly assigned to either the DEP or the conventional joint rehabilitation group. Primary end point for judging effectiveness was functional status assessed by HAQ. Secondary outcomes included Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale 2-Short Form (AIMS2-SF) and radiological worsening measured by Simple Narrowing Erosion Score (SENS). Clinical evaluation consisted of disease activity score (DAS 28), cycling aerobic fitness and dexterity. Dexterity was measured using Sequential Occupational Dexterity Assessment (SODA) and Duruoz Hand Index (DHI). Data were collected at baseline 1, 6 and 12 months.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Fifty patients were enrolled. HAQ improved throughout the length of the trial in the DEP group. This improvement was greater in DEP than in the standard joint rehabilitation group at 1 month (-0.2 vs no variation from baseline, P = 0.04), but not at 6 months (-0.2 vs -0.1 in control group, P = 0.25) or 12 months (-0.1 vs no variation in control group, P = 0.51). DEP improved NHP (-23 vs + 7% in control group, P = 0.01) and aerobic fitness (+0.3 vs + 0.1 km per 5 min in control group, P = 0.02) at 1 month but the progress was not statistically significant thereafter.

				<fragment>Forty-six primary total knee arthroplasties were performed using either an electromagnetic (EM) or infrared (IR) navigation system. In this IRB-approved study, patients were evaluated clinically and for accuracy using spiral computed tomographic imaging and 36-in standing radiographs. Although EM navigation was subject to metal interference, it was not as drastic as line-of-sight interference with IR navigation. Mechanical alignment was ideal in 92.9% of EM and 90.0% of IR cases based on spiral computed tomographic imaging and 100% of EM and 95% of IR cases based on x-ray. Individual measurements of component varus/valgus and sagittal measurements showed EM to be equivalent to IR, with both systems producing subdegree accuracy in 95% of the readings.</fragment>

We assessed the therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of oral potassium supplement dissolved in grape juice in female hypokalemic patients with active RA. Thirty-two hypokalemic patients with active RA were investigated in a parallel, randomized design. In addition to their usual medication, the control group received placebo and the intervention group received 6000 mg chloride potassium dissolved in grape juice on 28 consecutive days. The primary outcome parameter was the change of pain on a visual analog scale (VAS). The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) percent response criteria and Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28, 28-joint count) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) moderate response were assessed. Mean age was 48.6 +/- 6 years. In the potassium group, 43.75% (7/16) of the patients met the criteria of 33% lower pain intensity compared with 6.25% (1/16) in the placebo group (P &lt; .02) at day 28. Also, 31.25% (5/16) of the patients in the intervention group achieved moderate responses, according to the EULAR criteria. The corresponding percentage for patients receiving placebo was 6.25% (1/16) (P &lt; .05). Potassium supplements appeared to decrease pain intensity.</fragment>

			<section label="PERSPECTIVE" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>This article reports a trial evaluating the effect of potassium supplementation in the treatment of pain in hypokalemic patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The elevated serum cortisol and potassium values in the treatment group correlate negatively with patient's assessment of pain intensity, reflecting an anti-pain effect for potassium supplementation.</fragment>

				<fragment>Data of the 281 completers of a 2-yr randomized controlled trial (Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients In Training; RAPIT) comparing the effects of usual care physical therapy with high-intensity weight-bearing exercises were analysed. The primary outcome variable was defined as the change in radiological joint damage (Larsen score) of the large joints. Potential predictors of outcome were defined: baseline and change in serum level of COMP after 3 months, baseline radiological damage of the large and small joints, number of months on glucocorticoids, change in disease activity and in physical capacity (aerobic fitness and muscle strength) after 2 yrs, and participation in the exercise group.</fragment>

				<fragment>Dual-centre, double-blind placebo-controlled randomized study of 9 months' duration. Ninety-seven patients with RA were randomized to take either 10 g of cod liver oil containing 2.2 g of n-3 EFAs or air-filled identical placebo capsules. Documentation of NSAID daily requirement, clinical and laboratory parameters of RA disease activity and safety checks were done at 0, 4, 12, 24 and 36 weeks. At 12 weeks, patients were instructed to gradually reduce, and if possible, stop their NSAID intake.

				<fragment>Interleukin 6 is involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis via its broad effects on immune and inflammatory responses. Our aim was to assess the therapeutic effects of blocking interleukin 6 by inhibition of the interleukin-6 receptor with tocilizumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>In this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group phase III study, 623 patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis were randomly assigned with an interactive voice response system, stratified by site with a randomisation list provided by the study sponsor, to receive tocilizumab 8 mg/kg (n=205), tocilizumab 4 mg/kg (214), or placebo (204) intravenously every 4 weeks, with methotrexate at stable pre-study doses (10-25 mg/week). Rescue therapy with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg was offered at week 16 to patients with less than 20% improvement in both swollen and tender joint counts. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with 20% improvement in signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis according to American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20 response) at week 24.

			<section>
				<fragment>Atacicept is a recombinant fusion protein containing the extracellular ligand-binding portion of the transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI, CD267) receptor and inhibits B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS, CD257) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL, CD256), both potent stimulators of B cell maturation, proliferation, and survival. Atacicept pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were assessed in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase I study in patients with active, moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis receiving atacicept either as a single subcutaneous or repeated, every other week dose. Pharmacokinetic profiles were determined by measuring serum concentrations of free atacicept and its complex with BLyS. Nonspecific immunoglobulin (Ig)M, IgG, and IgA; IgM-RF (rheumatoid factor), IgG-RF, and IgA-RF antibody levels; and B cell profiles provided markers of biological activity. Pharmacokinetic, biological activity, and relationships between atacicept dose and Ig antibody response were evaluated. Pharmacokinetic profiles of atacicept were nonlinear, influenced by saturable binding with its ligands, but were consistent and predictable. Atacicept treatment reduced Ig and RF serum concentration. IgM antibody levels were most sensitive to atacicept, followed by IgA and IgG, underlining the biological activity of atacicept in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. These findings can be used to explore dosing regimen design scenarios in future studies.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>Emotional disclosure by writing or talking about stressful life experiences improves health status in non-clinical populations, but its success in clinical populations, particularly rheumatoid arthritis (RA), has been mixed. In this randomized, controlled trial, we attempted to increase the efficacy of emotional disclosure by having a trained clinician help patients emotionally disclose and process stressful experiences. We randomized 98 adults with RA to one of four conditions: (a) private verbal emotional disclosure; (b) clinician-assisted verbal emotional disclosure; (c) arthritis information control (all of which engaged in four, 30-min laboratory sessions); or (d) no-treatment, standard care only control group. Outcome measures (pain, disability, affect, stress) were assessed at baseline, 2 months following treatment (2-month follow-up), and at 5-month, and 15-month follow-ups. A manipulation check demonstrated that, as expected, both types of emotional disclosure led to immediate (post-session) increases in negative affect compared with arthritis information. Outcome analyses at all three follow-ups revealed no clear pattern of effects for either clinician-assisted or private emotional disclosure compared with the two control groups. There were some benefits in terms of a reduction in pain behavior with private disclosure vs. clinician-assisted disclosure at the 2-month follow-up, but no other significant between group differences. We conclude that verbal emotional disclosure about stressful experiences, whether conducted privately or assisted by a clinician, has little or no benefit for people with RA.</fragment>
