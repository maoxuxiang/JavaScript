		<summary>Total shoulder arthroplasty leads to significant improvements in scores for function and pain. Shoulder-specific measures of function consistently showed the greatest degree of improvement, with large effect sizes. Total shoulder arthroplasty also leads to significant improvements in overall physical well-being, with a moderate-to-large effect size.</summary>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Total shoulder arthroplasty is increasingly used in the treatment of arthritis. However, the effect of total shoulder arthroplasty on health-related quality of life has not been fully established. The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to characterize the change in generic and shoulder-specific health-related quality-of-life measures resulting from total shoulder arthroplasty.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We identified published studies reporting preoperative and postoperative health-related quality-of-life outcomes for patients receiving total shoulder arthroplasty. Health-related quality-of-life measures were identified, and meta-analysis was used to calculate standardized mean differences (SMDs, reflective of the effect size) and 95% confidence intervals for each scale.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Twenty studies (1576 total shoulder replacements) met the inclusion criteria. Outcome measures were analyzed after an average postoperative follow-up duration of 3.7 Â± 2.2 years. The Short Form-36 demonstrated significant improvement in physical component summary scores (SMD = 0.7, p &lt; 0.001) but not in mental component summary scores (SMD = 0.2, p = 0.37). Significant improvements were observed in the visual analog scale score for pain (SMD = -2.5, p &lt; 0.001) and scores on three shoulder-specific measures: the Constant score (SMD = 2.7, p &lt; 0.001), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (SMD = 2.9, p &lt; 0.001), and Simple Shoulder Test (SMD = 2.3, p &lt; 0.001).</fragment>

		<summary>The use of BRMs among patients with RA included in RCTs of at least 6 months' duration was not significantly associated with an increased risk of malignancy compared with other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or with placebo.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="CONTEXT" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Concerns exist regarding the potential development of malignancies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are receiving biologic response modifiers (BRMs).</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>To assess the risk of malignancy in patients with RA enrolled in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of BRMs.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="DATA SOURCES" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Electronic databases, conference proceedings, and websites of regulatory agencies were searched for RCTs evaluating abatacept, adalimumab, anakinra, certolizumab, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, rituximab, and tocilizumab in RA from inception through July 9, 2012.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="STUDY SELECTION" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Independent selection of studies included RCTs that compared the safety of any BRMs used in RA patients with placebo and/or any traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs with a minimum of 24 weeks of follow-up.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="DATA EXTRACTION" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Independent reviewers selected studies and extracted data on quality and outcomes. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each BRM.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Sixty-three RCTs with 29,423 patients were analyzed. No statistically significant increased risk of developing malignancy was observed. Of the 29,423 patients, 211 developed a malignancy during the trial (118 solid tumors, 48 skin cancers, 14 lymphomas, 5 hematologic nonlymphomas, and 26 not specified). The incidence rate for any malignancy during the first year of therapy was very low in the BRM plus methotrexate group (0.77%; 95% CI, 0.65%-0.92%), the BRM monotherapy group (0.64%; 95% CI, 0.42%-0.95%), and the controls (0.66%; 95% CI, 0.52%-0.84%). Anakinra plus methotrexate showed lower odds compared with methotrexate alone (Peto odds ratio, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03-0.45). No statistically significant risk was observed for specific cancer sites, although the Peto odds ratio for lymphoma was 2.1 (95% CI, 0.55-8.4) in patients receiving tumor necrosis factor inhibitors compared with controls.</fragment>

			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>To assess the relative efficacy of subsequent biologic therapies in patients with RA who have had an inadequate response to prior therapy with a TNF-Î± inhibitor.</fragment>

			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A systematic review was conducted using the MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library databases and abstract lists from the European League Against Rheumatism, American College of Rheumatology and British Society of Rheumatology congresses. Searches covered the period from May 2009 (August 2009 for MEDLINE) to January 2011.

			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Four full publications and 41 congress abstracts met the criteria for inclusion. Significant improvements in RA signs and symptoms were reported for TNF inhibitors (individual agents or groups of agents, depending on the study) and for abatacept and rituximab. Rituximab was also associated with significantly improved radiographic outcomes. No head-to-head randomized controlled trials directly comparing different agents were published during the search period. Comparative data from registries and other observational studies suggest that rituximab is at least as effective as an alternative TNF inhibitor, and in some studies significantly more effective, in TNF inadequate responders.</fragment>

		<content>
			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>To critically review the evidence on the effectiveness of complementary therapies for patients with RA.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Randomized controlled trials, published in English up to May 2011, were identified using systematic searches of bibliographic databases and searching of reference lists. Information was extracted on outcomes and statistical significance in comparison with alternative treatments and reported side effects. The methodological quality of the identified studies was determined using the Jadad scoring system. All outcomes were considered but with a focus on patient global assessment and pain reporting.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Eleven eligible trials were identified covering seven therapies. Three trials that compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture reported no significant difference in pain reduction between the groups but one out of two reported an improvement in patient global assessment. Except for reduction in physician's global assessment of treatment and disease activity reported in one trial, no other comparative benefit of acupuncture was seen. There were two studies on meditation and one each on autogenic training, healing therapy, progressive muscle relaxation, static magnets and tai chi. None of these trials reported positive comparative effects on pain but some positive effects on patient global assessment were noted at individual time points in the healing therapy and magnet therapy studies. A small number of other outcomes showed comparative improvement in individual trials. There were no reports of major adverse events. Conclusion: The very limited evidence available indicates that for none of the practitioner-based complementary therapies considered here is there good evidence of efficacy or effectiveness in the management of RA.</fragment>

			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>To evaluate the efficacy of resistance exercises in RA patients.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A systematic literature search was done using Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane databases through November 2009 and in abstracts presented at rheumatology scientific meetings over the past 3 years. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing resistance exercise based therapy with interventions without resistance exercise for the treatment of RA patients were included. Outcomes studied were post-intervention disability on the HAQ, functional capacity assessed by walking speed, pain on the visual analogue scale (VAS), joint count, isometric, isokinetic and grip strength. Efficacy was assessed by weighted mean differences (WMDs) and tolerance was assessed by relative risk (RR). Data were pooled using the inverse of variance model, and heterogeneity was tested.</fragment>

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Ten RCTs, including 547 patients, met the study inclusion criteria. The mean (S.D.) Jadad score was 2.3 (0.6). Resistance exercises significantly improved isokinetic strength (WMDâ=â23.7%, Pâ&lt;â0.001), isometric strength (WMDâ=â35.8%, Pâ&lt;â0.001), grip strength (WMDâ=â26.4%, Pâ&lt;â0.001) and HAQ (WMDâ=â-0.22, Pâ&lt;â0.001).

		<summary>The link between systemic inflammation and vascular function and morphology is not wholly supported by the available literature. Long-term studies examining specific predictors (including CVD risk factors) on the vasculature in RA are needed.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="OBJECTIVES" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>RA associates with significantly increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD). This may be due to complex interactions between traditional CVD risk factors, systemic rheumatoid inflammation and the vasculature. We reviewed the current literature to answer: (i) whether there is sufficient evidence that patients with RA have altered vascular function and morphology compared with normal controls; (ii) whether there is sufficient evidence to determine if such changes relate predominantly to systemic inflammation; and (iii) whether any changes of vascular function and morphology in RA can be modified with therapy.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>The MEDLINE database was searched to identify publications from 1974 to 1 November 2010 pertaining to vascular function and morphology in RA.

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Vascular function and morphology was impaired in RA relative to healthy controls. The majority of studies reported no associations between systemic inflammation and vascular function.

		<summary>Two claims-based indices of RA severity were identified but have some limitations for routine use. A concerted effort from experts in the field is needed to define, develop, and validate a widely applicable measure of RA disease severity for administrative database research.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>We aimed to systematically review rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease severity indices for use in administrative healthcare databases. We also provide an overview of alternative methods to control for RA disease severity in administrative database research.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We conducted a systematic review of studies that developed/validated an index for RA disease severity using variables in administrative databases, and compared the convergent validity/reliability of the index with a standard measure of RA severity.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>After reviewing 539 articles, 2 studies were included. The claims-based index for RA severity (CIRAS) was developed in one study. Components of the CIRAS included tests for inflammatory markers, number of chemistry panels/platelet counts ordered, rheumatoid factor test, number of rehabilitation and rheumatology visits, and Felty's syndrome. The CIRAS correlated moderately well with a previously validated RA medical records-based index of severity. The second study assessed whether current and lifetime treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and/or biologics accurately predicted RA severity, as measured by the patient-reported Patient Activity Scale (PAS). Treatment variables did not fully distinguish patients in the highest and lowest quartiles of PAS scores (67.2% correctly classified).</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>Two claims-based indices of RA severity were identified but have some limitations for routine use. A concerted effort from experts in the field is needed to define, develop, and validate a widely applicable measure of RA disease severity for administrative database research.</fragment>

				<fragment>Thirty-five studies were included in the systematic review: five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one comparative study, one controlled study and 28 uncontrolled studies. One RCT (REFLEX) demonstrated the effectiveness of RTX. At 6 months significantly more patients treated with RTX achieved American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 [relative risk (RR) = 2.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.08 to 3.91] and ACR70 (RR = 12.14, 95% CI 2.96 to 49.86) compared with those treated with the placebo. Differences between groups in favour of RTX were observed at 6 months for mean change from baseline in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) (mean difference -1.50, 95% CI -1.74 to -1.26) and mean change from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score (mean difference -0.30, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.20). One RCT (ATTAIN) demonstrated the effectiveness of ABT. At 6 months significantly more patients treated with ABT achieved ACR20 (RR = 2.56, 95% CI 1.77 to 3.69) and ACR70 (RR = 6.70, 95% CI 1.62 to 27.80) compared with those treated with placebo. Significant differences between groups in favour of ABT were observed at 6 months for mean change from baseline in DAS28 score (mean difference -1.27, 95% CI -1.62 to -0.93) and mean change from baseline in HAQ score (mean difference -0.34). Twenty-eight uncontrolled studies observed improvement of effectiveness compared with before switching, in patients who switched to ADA, ETN or IFX after discontinued previous TNF inhibitor(s). Four studies were included in the systematic review of cost-effectiveness. Independent economic evaluation undertaken by the assessment group showed that compared with DMARDs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were Â£34,300 [per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)] for ADA, Â£38,800 for ETN, Â£36,200 for IFX, Â£21,200 for RTX and Â£38,600 for ABT. RTX dominates the TNF inhibitors and the ICER for ABT compared with RTX is over Â£100,000 (per QALY).</fragment>

				<fragment>Electronic databases (AMED, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, HMIC, HTA, MEDLINE, NHEED, Ovid Nursing and PsycINFO) were searched from 1988 to January 2010 with no language restrictions. Inclusion criteria were: randomised controlled trials, nurse-led care being part of the intervention and including patients with RA.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="REVIEW METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Quality assessment was conducted independently by two reviewers using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool. For each outcome measure, the effect size was assessed using risk ratio or ratio of means (RoM) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) as appropriate. Where possible, data from similar outcomes were pooled in a meta-analysis.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Seven records representing 4 RCTs with an overall low risk of bias (good quality) were included in the review. They included 431 patients and the interventions (nurse-led care vs usual care) lasted for 1-2years. Most effect sizes of disease activity measures were inconclusive (DAS28 RoM=0.96, 95%CI [0.90-1.02], P=0.16; plasma viscosity RoM=1 95%CI [0.8-1.26], p=0.99) except the Ritchie Articular Index (RoM=0.89, 95%CI [0.84-0.95], P&lt;0.001) which favoured nurse-led care. Results from some secondary outcomes (functional status, stiffness and coping with arthritis) were also inconclusive. Other outcomes (satisfaction and pain) displayed mixed results when assessed using different tools making them also inconclusive. Significant effects of nurse-led care were seen in quality of life (RAQoL RoM=0.83, 95%CI [0.75-0.92], P&lt;0.001), patient knowledge (PKQ RoM=4.39, 95%CI [3.35-5.72], P&lt;0.001) and fatigue (median difference=-330, P=0.02).</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="CONCLUSIONS" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>The estimates of the primary outcome and most secondary outcomes showed no significant difference between nurse-led care and the usual care. While few outcomes favoured nurse-led care, there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether this is the case. More good quality RCTs of nurse-led care effectiveness in rheumatoid arthritis are required.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>From individual randomized studies, it is not clear whether a closed suction drainage should be used after total knee arthroplasty. Our meta-analysis compares the clinical outcomes of closed suction drainage with nondrainage after total knee arthroplasty in randomized controlled trials reported between January 1966 and May 2010. Fifteen eligible trials involving 1361 knee incisions (686 knees with closed suction drainage and 675 knees without drainage) satisfied the inclusion criteria for our meta-analysis. The result of the meta-analysis indicates that closed suction drainage reduces the incidence of soft tissue ecchymosis and requirement for dressing reinforcement, but increases the rate of homologous blood transfusion. No significant difference between drainage and nondrainage was observed in the incidence of infection, deep venous thrombosis, or postoperative range of motion.</fragment>

				<fragment>To perform a Cochrane systematic review of benefit (American College of Rheumatology 50% improvement criteria; ACR50) and safety (adverse events and withdrawals) of golimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), OVID Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Science Citation Index (Web of Science), and Current Controlled Trials databases for randomized or controlled clinical trials of golimumab compared to placebo or disease-modifying antirheumatic drug in adults with RA. Two authors independently selected appropriate studies and abstracted study characteristics and safety and efficacy data and performed risk-of-bias assessment. We calculated mean differences for continuous measures, and relative risks for categorical measures.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Four randomized controlled trials with 1231 golimumab-treated and 483 placebo-treated patients were included. Of these, 436 were treated with golimumab at 50 mg every 4 weeks [a dosage approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]. At an average of 4-6 months, compared to patients treated with placebo and methotrexate (MTX), patients treated with the FDA-approved dosage of golimumab and MTX were 2.6 times more likely to reach ACR50 (p = 0.005, 95% CI 1.3, 4.9; absolute percentage, 38% vs 15%) and 0.5 times as likely to have overall withdrawals (p = 0.005, 95% CI 0.3, 0.8; absolute percentage, 5% vs 10%). Golimumab-treated patients were significantly more likely than those taking placebo to achieve remission (22% vs 4%; p &lt; 0.00001), and to have improvement in functional ability on the Health Assessment questionnaire [0.2 points lower (p &lt; 0.00001, 95% CI 0.25, 0.15); absolute risk difference, -20% (95% CI -25% to -15%); relative percentage difference, -11% (95% CI -14% to -8.3%)]. The studies were too small and short to be powered sufficiently for safety outcomes, but no substantive statistically significant differences were noted between golimumab and placebo regarding adverse events, serious adverse events, infections, serious infections, lung infections, tuberculosis, cancer, withdrawals due to adverse events, and withdrawals due to inefficacy and deaths.</fragment>

		<summary>Based on the published literature, MTX has limited drug interactions, with the exception of TMP-SMX and high-dose ASA, which can exacerbate toxicity of MTX. The clinical significance of these interactions has not been substantiated by extensive clinical observations.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) often have comorbidities that require multiple medications. Several of these medications may alter the efficacy or increase the toxicity of methotrexate (MTX). The purpose of our study was to determine which drugs used in combination with MTX (excluding disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, folic and folinic acid, corticosteroids, and biologic agents) enhance side effects or toxicity of MTX or lower its efficacy.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A systematic literature search was performed with Medline, Embase, Cochrane Register and Database, and abstracts from the 2006/2007 annual congresses of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism. A manual search of the citation lists of retrieved publications was performed.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Of the 1172 articles identified, 67 were included: 21 pharmacokinetics studies, 5 observational studies, and 78 case reports. Most medications do not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics profile of MTX. Among the clinical studies, cytopenia and elevation of liver enzymes were the main reported toxicities. The use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was mentioned as a risk factor for developing cytopenia in one observational study and in 17 case reports. Thirty case reports of cytopenia were attributed to the use of concomitant nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, including acetylsalicylic acid. Two studies described mild abnormalities of liver enzymes with the use of isoniazid, and one study with the use of high-dose ASA.</fragment>

			</section>
			<section label="MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>A literature search of several databases from January 1995-December 2008 was performed. There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication, and low-quality studies (based on Jadad score) were excluded. American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20% improvement criteria (ACR20), 50% improvement criteria (ACR50), and 70% improvement criteria (ACR70) were used to compare treatment efficacy. Safety was compared based on frequency of serious adverse events, serious infections, malignancy, and death. Withdrawals due to adverse events and lack of efficacy were also evaluated. With short-term treatment (12-30 wks), etanercept demonstrated the highest risk ratios (RRs) for reaching ACR20 and ACR50: 2.94 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.27-3.81) and 5.28 (95% CI 3.12-8.92), respectively. Adalimumab demonstrated the highest RR for achieving ACR70 (5.36, 95% CI 3.76- 7.64). Over a long-term treatment course (1-3 yrs), adalimumab demonstrated the highest RRs (95% CIs) for these parameters: 1.85 (1.07-3.19), 2.80 (1.16-6.77), and 3.23 (1.37-7.61) for ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70, respectively. No statistically significant differences were noted in the safety of any of the three drugs compared with placebo. Infliximab had the highest RRs for withdrawing from the study due to lack of efficacy (2.05, 95% CI 1.33-3.16) and adverse events (0.41, 95% CI 0.18-0.95).</fragment>

		<summary>Our results show that RA is associated with a 60% increase in risk of CV death compared with general population.

		<title>A systematic review of the psychometric properties of the Constant-Murley score.</title>
		<link href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19559630" title="A systematic review of the psychometric properties of the Constant-Murley score."/>
		<id>19559630</id>
		<updated>2010-12-16</updated>
		<summary>This systematic review provides evidence to support the use of the Constant-Murley score for specific clinical and research applications but underscores the need for greater standardization and precaution when interpreting scores.

			<section label="HYPOTHESIS" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the psychometric evidence relating to Constant-Murley score.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="MATERIALS AND METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A search of 3 databases (Medline, CINAHL, and EMBASE) and a manual search yielded 35 relevant publications. Pairs of raters used structured tools to analyze these articles, through critical appraisal and data extraction. A descriptive synthesis of the psychometric evidence was then performed.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Quality ratings of 23% of the studies reviewed reached a level of 75% or higher. Studies evaluating the content validity of the Constant-Murley score suggest that the description in the original publication is insufficient to accomplish standardization between centers and evaluators. Despite this limitation, the Constant-Murley score correlates strongly (&gt;or= 0.70) with shoulder-specific questionnaires, reaches acceptable benchmarks (rho &gt; 0.80) for its reliability coefficients, and is responsive (effect sizes and standardized response mean &gt; 0.80) for detecting improvement after intervention in a variety of shoulder pathologies.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="DISCUSSION" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>This systematic review provides evidence to support the use of the Constant-Murley score for specific clinical and research applications but underscores the need for greater standardization and precaution when interpreting scores. Methods to improve standardization and measurement precision are needed. Responsiveness has been shown to be excellent, but some properties still need be evaluated, particularly those related to the absolute errors of measurement and minimal clinically important difference.</fragment>

		<summary>Medium- to long-term glucocorticoid therapy in RA is associated with limited toxicity compared to placebo.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses have confirmed clinical efficacy of glucocorticoids in RA. Concerns regarding safety associated with medium- to long-term use in RA have limited their use in clinical practice. In this meta-analysis, we assessed the toxicity related to medium- to long-term (defined as 1 year or longer) glucocorticoid therapy in RA.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL databases were searched for RCTs of glucocorticoids in RA. RCTs fulfilling the following criteria were included: double-blinded, placebo-controlled, lasted 1 year or longer, used prednisolone (or equivalent) and in English. Toxicity was assessed by number of the patients withdrawn for adverse events (AEs), and the numbers of serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs. RCTs were compared by meta-analysis using odd ratios (OR) with 95% CIs.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Six RCTs with total of 689 patients met the inclusion criteria. All RCTs lasted &gt;or=2 years. All studies allowed concomitant use of NSAIDs and DMARDs.

		<summary>In this systematic review, outcomes for total wrist fusion were comparable and possibly better than those for total wrist arthroplasty in rheumatoid patients. In this era of cost-conscious medical care, expensive interventions must demonstrate superior outcomes. Existing data do not support widespread application of total wrist arthroplasty for the rheumatoid arthritis wrist.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Management of the end-stage rheumatoid wrist is controversial. The most common treatment is total wrist fusion. Total wrist arthroplasty offers a motion-preserving alternative. Comparison of outcomes for total wrist arthroplasty and total wrist fusion is necessary for evidence-based decision making. The purpose of this systematic review was to scientifically evaluate the existing literature for outcomes of both procedures in rheumatoid arthritis.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A MEDLINE database review was performed. Search included "wrist and arthroplasty," "wrist and arthrodesis," and "wrist and fusion." Silicone arthroplasty was excluded. Data extraction included demographic information, surgical technique, pain, and active arc of motion. Complications and satisfaction were recorded.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Literature review identified 1750 citations that were screened for inclusion criteria. Formal review identified 18 total wrist arthroplasty studies representing approximately 500 procedures. Data from 20 total wrist fusion studies represented over 800 procedures. Comparison of outcomes showed that total wrist fusion provides more reliable relief than total wrist arthroplasty. Complication and revision rates were higher for total wrist arthroplasty. Satisfaction was high in both groups. Postoperative motion was reviewed to evaluate whether arthroplasty provides a functional active arc of motion. Of 14 studies reporting appropriate data, three showed average active arc of motion within the functional range.</fragment>

			<section>
				<fragment>The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the available evidence, from randomized clinical trials (RCTs), of acupuncture for treating patients with RA. Systematic searches were conducted on 17 databases up to April 2008 without the language restriction. All RCTs of acupuncture, with or without electrical stimulation or moxibustion, for patients with RA were considered for inclusion. A total of 236 potentially relevant studies were identified and eight RCTs were included. Four RCTs compared the effects of manual or electro-acupuncture with penetrating or non-penetrating sham acupuncture and failed to show specific effects of acupuncture on pain [n = 88; weighted mean differences (WMD), 10 cm VAS -0.46; 95% CI -1.70, 0.77; P = 0.46; heterogeneity: tau(2) = 0.19; chi(2) = 2.38; P = 0.30; I (2) = 16%] or other outcome measures. One RCT compared manual acupuncture with indomethacin and suggested favourable effects of acupuncture in terms of total response rate. Three RCTs tested acupuncture combined with moxibustion, vs conventional drugs and failed to show that acupuncture plus moxibustion was superior to conventional drugs in terms of response rate (n = 345; RR 1.12; 95% CI 0.99, 1.28; P = 0.08; heterogeneity: tau(2) = 0.00; chi(2) = 1.34; P = 0.51; I(2) = 0%), pain reduction (n = 105; WMD, 10 cm VAS 1.53; 95% CI -0.57, 3.63; P = 0.15; heterogeneity: tau(2) = 1.18; chi(2) = 1.81; P = 0.18; I(2) = 45%) or joint swelling index (n = 105; WMD, 10 cm VAS 0.25; 95% CI -1.31, 1.82; P = 0.75; heterogeneity: tau(2) = 0.18;chi(2) = 1.14; P = 0.28; I(2) = 13%). In conclusion, penetrating or non-penetrating sham-controlled RCTs failed to show specific effects of acupuncture for pain control in patients with RA. More rigorous research seems to be warranted.</fragment>

		<summary>The COX-2 selective NSAIDs examined were found to be similar to non-selective NSAIDs for the symptomatic relief of RA and OA and to provide superior GI tolerability (the majority of evidence is in patients with OA). Although COX-2 selective NSAIDs offer protection against serious GI events, the amount of evidence for this protective effect varied considerably across individual drugs. The volume of trial evidence with regard to cardiovascular safety also varied substantially between COX-2 selective NSAIDs. Increased risk of MI compared to non-selective NSAIDs was observed among those drugs with greater volume of evidence in terms of exposure in patient-years. Economic modelling shows a wide range of possible costs per QALY gained in patients with OA and RA. Costs per QALY also varied if individual drugs were used in 'standard' or 'high'-risk patients, the choice of non-selective NSAID comparator and whether that NSAID was combined with a PPI. With reduced costs of PPIs, future primary research needs to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of COX-2 selective NSAIDs relative to non-selective NSAIDs with a PPI. Direct comparisons of different COX-2 selective NSAIDs, using equivalent doses, that compare GI and MI risk are needed. Pragmatic studies that include a wider range of people, including the older age groups with a greater burden of arthritis, are also necessary to inform clinical practice.</summary>

			<section label="OBJECTIVES" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>To review the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (etodolac, meloxicam, celecoxib, rofecoxib, etoricoxib, valdecoxib and lumiracoxib) for osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</fragment>

			<section label="DATA SOURCES" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Electronic databases were searched up to November 2003. Industry submissions to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in 2003 were also reviewed.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="REVIEW METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and a model-based economic evaluation were undertaken. Meta-analyses were undertaken for each COX-2 selective NSAID compared with placebo and non-selective NSAIDs. The model was designed to run in two forms: the 'full Assessment Group Model (AGM)', which includes an initial drug switching cycle, and the 'simpler AGM', where there is no initial cycle and no opportunity for the patient to switch NSAID.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Compared with non-selective NSAIDs, the COX-2 selective NSAIDs were found to be equally as efficacious as the non-selective NSAIDs (although meloxicam was found to be of inferior or equivalent efficacy) and also to be associated with significantly fewer clinical upper gastrointestinal (UGI) events (although relatively small numbers of clinical gastrointestinal (GI) and myocardial infarction (MI) events were reported across trials). Subgroup analyses of clinical and complicated UGI events and MI events in relation to aspirin use, steroid use, prior GI history and Helicobacter pylori status were based on relatively small numbers and were inconclusive. In the RCTs that included direct COX-2 comparisons, the drugs were equally tolerated and of equal efficacy. Trials were of insufficient size and duration to allow comparison of risk of clinical UGI events, complicated UGI events and MIs. One RCT compared COX-2 (celecoxib) with a non-selective NSAID combined with a gastroprotective agent (diclofenac combined with omeprazole); this included arthritis patients who had recently suffered a GI haemorrhage. Although no significant difference in clinical GI events was reported, the number of events was small and more such studies, where patients genuinely need NSAIDs, are required to confirm these data. A second trial showed that rofecoxib was associated with fewer diarrhoea events than a combination of diclofenac and misoprostol (Arthrotec). Previously published cost-effectiveness analyses indicated a wide of range of possible incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained estimates. Using the simpler AGM, with ibuprofen or diclofenac alone as the comparator, all of the COX-2 products are associated with higher costs (i.e. positive incremental costs) and small increases in effectiveness (i.e. positive incremental effectiveness), measured in terms of QALYs. The magnitude of the incremental costs and the incremental effects, and therefore the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, vary considerably across all COX-2 selective NSAIDs. The base-case incremental cost per QALY results for COX-2 selective NSAIDs compared with diclofenac for the simpler model are: celecoxib (low dose) 68,400 pounds; celecoxib (high dose) 151,000 pounds; etodolac (branded) 42,400 pounds; etodolac (generic) 17,700 pounds; etoricoxib 31,300 pounds; lumiracoxib 70,400 pounds; meloxicam (low dose) 10,300 pounds; meloxicam (high dose) 17,800 pounds; rofecoxib 97,400 pounds; and valdecoxib 35,500 pounds. When the simpler AGM was run using ibuprofen or diclofenac combined with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) as the comparator, the results change substantially, with the COX-2 selective NSAIDs looking generally unattractive from a cost-effectiveness point of view (COX-2 selective NSAIDs were dominated by ibuprofen or diclofenac combined with PPI in most cases). This applies both to 'standard' and 'high-risk' arthritis patients defined in terms of previous GI ulcers. The full AGM produced results broadly in line with the simpler model.</fragment>

		<summary>Mandibular distraction osteogenesis is effective in treating craniofacial deformities, but further clinical trials are required to assess the long-term stability and to compare the treatment with conventional treatment methods, especially in cases of obstructive sleep apnea or class II mandibular hypoplasia.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Mandibular distraction osteogenesis has been used effectively to treat syndromic craniofacial deformities. In recent years, its scope of application has widened to include treatment of airway obstruction in adults and children and nonsyndromic class II mandibular hypoplasia. So far, there has been no evidence-based review of mandibular distraction osteogenesis for mandibular lengthening.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>Two rounds of searches were performed by two independent assessors. The first-round PubMed search used the keywords "mandible" and "distraction osteogenesis." In the second-round search, the reference lists of the articles were retrieved. For both rounds, abstracts and then full articles were reviewed and selected on the basis of a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>The 178 retrieved articles yielded 1185 mandibular distraction osteogenesis patients: 539 received unilateral mandibular distraction osteogenesis and 646 received bilateral mandibular distraction osteogenesis. Mandibular distraction osteogenesis was reported to improve facial asymmetry and retrognathia (50.1 percent), correct the slanted lip commissure (24.7 percent), and improve or level the mandibular occlusal plane (11.1 percent) in unilateral asymmetry cases, whereas bilateral mandibular distraction osteogenesis was shown to be effective in preventing tracheostomies for 91.3 percent of neonates or infants with respiratory distress, and in relieving symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea for 97.0 percent of children and 100 percent of adult patients.</fragment>

			<section label="CONCLUSIONS" id="CONCLUSIONS">
				<fragment>Mandibular distraction osteogenesis is effective in treating craniofacial deformities, but further clinical trials are required to assess the long-term stability and to compare the treatment with conventional treatment methods, especially in cases of obstructive sleep apnea or class II mandibular hypoplasia.</fragment>

		<title>Rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease and physical exercise: a systematic review.</title>

		<content>
			<section>
				<fragment>This systematic review investigates the effectiveness of exercise interventions in improving disease-related characteristics in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It also provides suggestions for exercise programmes suitable for improving the cardiovascular profile of RA patients and proposes areas for future research in the field. Six databases (Medline, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Google Scholar, EMBASE and PEDro) were searched to identify publications from 1974 to December 2006 regarding RA and exercise interventions. The quality of the studies included was determined by using the Jadad scale. Initial searches identified 1342 articles from which 40 met the inclusion criteria. No studies were found investigating exercise interventions in relation to cardiovascular disease in RA. There is strong evidence suggesting that exercise from low to high intensity of various modes is effective in improving disease-related characteristics and functional ability in RA patients. Future studies are required to investigate the effects of exercise in improving the cardiovascular status of this patient population.</fragment>
