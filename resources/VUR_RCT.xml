		<summary>RIVUR is the largest prospective, randomized trial for children with primary VUR to date, comparing prophylaxis with placebo. The study sample comprises patients from 19 pediatric clinical sites in the United States, whose demographic and clinical characteristics may differ from those of children enrolled in previous trials from other countries.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is diagnosed in ∼30% to 40% of children who have imaging studies after urinary tract infections (UTIs). Our goal is to characterize children enrolled in the Randomized Intervention for Children with Vesicoureteral Reflux (RIVUR) trial and to compare our study cohort with those from previously published studies.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>RIVUR investigators from 19 pediatric sites in the United States recruited 607 children with grade I through IV VUR. Children were enrolled after a first or second UTI. This cross-sectional report of baseline data includes extensive clinical, parental report, and imaging study results.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>RIVUR recruited 607 children (558 girls, 49 boys) with grade I (11%), II (42%), III (38%), or IV (8%) reflux. The median age was 12 months, and most children (91%) were enrolled after their first UTI. The UTI leading to enrollment was both febrile and symptomatic for 323 children, febrile only in 197 children, and symptomatic only in 86. Renal involvement at baseline as documented by a (99m)Tc dimercaptosuccinic acid scan was uncommon with cortical defects identified in 89 (15%) children. Bladder and bowel dysfunction was identified in 71 (56%) of 126 toilet-trained subjects assessed.</fragment>

		<summary>Ureteral advancement is a simple and feasible procedure in laparoscopic ureteral extravesical reimplantation and may improve the resolution rate of vesicoureteral reflux.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="PURPOSE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Laparoscopic extravesical ureteral reimplantation for vesicoureteral reflux has gained acceptance as a feasible treatment associated with minimal morbidity. However, ureteral advancement with this technique has not been attempted. We examined the usefulness of ureteral advancement via laparoscopy.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="MATERIALS AND METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A total of 30 patients with 51 refluxing ureters underwent laparoscopic extravesical ureteral reimplantation for treatment of vesicoureteral reflux between August 2009 and September 2011. Mean ± SD patient age was 60.8 ± 48.6 months. During the procedure 15 patients underwent ureteral advancement (advancement group), while 15 did not (nonadvancement group). We compared operative times and postoperative rates of urinary tract infections and persistent reflux between the groups.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>There was no significant difference in operative times in unilateral (mean ± SD 110 ± 25 vs 125 ± 42 minutes) and bilateral cases (mean ± SD 214 ± 52 vs 203 ± 40 minutes) between the nonadvancement vs advancement groups. All patients underwent voiding cystourethrography 3 to 4 months postoperatively. Reflux resolution rate for ureters was significantly higher in the advancement group (100%) than in the nonadvancement group (85%, p &lt;0.05). No patient in the advancement group had postoperative urinary tract infection. Fixation of the ureter with the bladder muscularis at the proximal limit of the detrusor defect and/or a percutaneous hitch stitch placed in the ventral side of the proximal limit of the detrusor defect facilitated ureteral advancement.</fragment>

		<id>20850812</id>
		<updated>2010-10-11</updated>
		<summary>Special attention should be given to secondary causes of vesicoureteral reflux (such as primary bladder neck dysfunction, an underdiagnosed entity in children), since conventional treatment will most likely fail if these conditions are not addressed promptly. In this study prazosin was effective therapy for children with vesicoureteral reflux and primary bladder neck dysfunction.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="PURPOSE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Primary bladder neck dysfunction has been under diagnosed as a treatable cause of vesicoureteral reflux. We evaluated the effect of prazosin administration on vesicoureteral reflux resolution and urodynamic parameters in children with idiopathic primary reflux and primary bladder neck dysfunction.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="MATERIALS AND METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>A total of 62 children (mean ± SD age 7.9 ± 2.4 years) with documented vesicoureteral reflux and urodynamics proved primary bladder neck dysfunction were randomized to receive either 0.025 mg/kg α-blocker (prazosin, 40 patients) or placebo (22) nightly for 1 week with a subsequent increase to 2 divided doses. Patients were followed for 12 months with clinical evaluation and uroflowmetry performed every 2 months, and each patient underwent complete urodynamic study at 6-month intervals.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>In the placebo group no uroflowmetry or urodynamic parameter changed significantly at 1-year followup. A 60% decrease in reflux grade was observed in the treatment group compared to 17% in the placebo group. Mean maximal detrusor pressure, post-void residual and opening time were significantly decreased in both followup sessions in the prazosin group (p &lt;0.05). Average flow rate improved from 4.30 to 12.80 ml per second at 6 months and to 13.10 ml per second at 12 months (both p &lt;0.05).</fragment>

However, of concern is the common reappearance of dilating reflux after 2 years.</fragment>

				<fragment>Children 1 to younger than 2 years with grade III-IV reflux were recruited into this prospective, open, randomized, controlled, multicenter study and followed for 2 years after randomization. The main study end points were recurrent febrile urinary tract infection, renal status on dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy and reflux status. Outcomes were analyzed by the intent to treat principle.</fragment>

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>During a 6-year period 128 girls and 75 boys entered the study. In 96% of cases reflux was detected after urinary tract infection. The randomization procedure was successful and resulted in 3 groups matched for relevant factors. Recruitment was slower than anticipated but after patients were entered adherence to the protocol was good. Of the children 93% were followed for the intended 2 years without a treatment arm change. All except 2 patients completed 2-year followup scintigraphy.</fragment>

			<section label="BACKGROUND" id="BACKGROUND">
				<fragment>Antibiotics are widely administered to children with the intention of preventing urinary tract infection, but adequately powered, placebo-controlled trials regarding efficacy are lacking. This study from four Australian centers examined whether low-dose, continuous oral antibiotic therapy prevents urinary tract infection in predisposed children.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We randomly assigned children under the age of 18 years who had had one or more microbiologically proven urinary tract infections to receive either daily trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole suspension (as 2 mg of trimethoprim plus 10 mg of sulfamethoxazole per kilogram of body weight) or placebo for 12 months. The primary outcome was microbiologically confirmed symptomatic urinary tract infection. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed with the use of time-to-event data.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>From December 1998 to March 2007, a total of 576 children (of 780 planned) underwent randomization. The median age at entry was 14 months; 64% of the patients were girls, 42% had known vesicoureteral reflux (at least grade III in 53% of these patients), and 71% were enrolled after the first diagnosis of urinary tract infection. During the study, urinary tract infection developed in 36 of 288 patients (13%) in the group receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (antibiotic group) and in 55 of 288 patients (19%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the antibiotic group, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.93; P = 0.02 by the log-rank test). In the antibiotic group, the reduction in the absolute risk of urinary tract infection (6 percentage points) appeared to be consistent across all subgroups of patients (P &gt; or = 0.20 for all interactions).</fragment>

		<updated>2009-06-12</updated>
		<summary>Methodology and image quality for (99m)technetium dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy varied more than expected between institutions. The most common reason for poor image quality was inadequate count acquisition with insufficient attention to the tradeoff between administered dose, length of image acquisition, start time of imaging and resulting image quality. Inter-observer core reader agreement was high. The pilot study ensured good diagnostic quality standardized images for the Randomized Intervention for Children With Vesicoureteral Reflux investigation.</summary>

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>We evaluated 70, (99m)technetium dimercapto-succinic acid studies from 14 institutions. Variability was noted in methodology and image quality.

For pinhole imaging the correlation was poor (r = 0.110). A total of 10 studies (17%) were rejected for quality issues of motion, kidney overlap, inadequate magnification, inadequate counts and poor quality images. The submitting institution was informed and provided with recommendations for improving quality, and resubmission of another study was required.

		<summary>For children with or without primary nonsevere reflux, prophylaxis does not reduce the rate of recurrent febrile urinary tract infections after the first episode.</summary>
		<content>
			<section label="OBJECTIVES" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Febrile urinary tract infections are common in children and associated with the risk for renal scarring and long-term complications. Antimicrobial prophylaxis has been used to reduce the risk for recurrence. We performed a study to determine whether no prophylaxis is similar to antimicrobial prophylaxis for 12 months in reducing the recurrence of febrile urinary tract infections in children after a first febrile urinary tract infection.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>The study was a controlled, randomized, open-label, 2-armed, noninferiority trial comparing no prophylaxis with prophylaxis (co-trimoxazole 15 mg/kg per day or co-amoxiclav 15 mg/kg per day) for 12 months. A total of 338 children who were aged 2 months to &lt;7 years and had a first episode of febrile urinary tract infection were enrolled: 309 with a confirmed pyelonephritis on a technetium 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scan with or without reflux and 27 with a clinical pyelonephritis and reflux. The primary end point was recurrence rate of febrile urinary tract infections during 12 months. Secondary end point was the rate of renal scarring produced by recurrent urinary tract infections on technetium 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scan after 12 months.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant differences in the primary outcome between no prophylaxis and prophylaxis: 12 (9.45%) of 127 vs 15 (7.11%) of 211. In the subgroup of children with reflux, the recurrence of febrile urinary tract infections was 9 (19.6%) of 46 on no prophylaxis and 10 (12.1%) of 82 on prophylaxis. No significant difference was found in the secondary outcome: 2 (1.9%) of 108 on no prophylaxis versus 2 (1.1%) of 187 on prophylaxis. Bivariate analysis and Cox proportional hazard model showed that grade III reflux was a risk factor for recurrent febrile urinary tract infections. Whereas increasing age was protective, use of no prophylaxis was not a risk factor.</fragment>
