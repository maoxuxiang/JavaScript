				<fragment>Controversy exists regarding the type and/or sequence of imaging studies needed during the first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in young children. Several investigators have claimed that because acute-phase Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal-scan results are abnormal in the presence of dilating vesicoureteral reflux, a normal DMSA-scan result makes voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) unnecessary in the primary examination of infants with UTI. To evaluate the accuracy of acute-phase DMSA scanning in identifying dilating (grades III through V) vesicoureteral reflux documented by VCUG in children with a first febrile UTI, we performed a meta-analysis of the accuracy of diagnostic tests as reported from relevant studies identified through the PubMed and Scopus databases. Patient-based and renal unit-based analyses were performed. Overall, 13 cohort studies were identified. Nine studies involved patients younger than 2 years, 3 involved children aged 16 years or younger, and 1 involved exclusively neonates. Girls constituted 22% to 85% of the involved children. Pooled (95% confidence intervals) sensitivity and specificity rates of DMSA scanning were 79% and 53%, respectively, for the patient-based analysis (8 studies) and 60% and 65% for the renal unit-based analysis (5 studies). The respective areas under the hierarchical summary receiver operating curves were 0.71 and 0.67. Marked statistical heterogeneity was observed in both analyses, as indicated by I(2) test values of 91% and 87%, respectively. Acute-phase DMSA renal scanning cannot be recommended as replacement for VCUG in the evaluation of young children with a first febrile UTI.</fragment>

				<fragment>To assess the predictive value of procalcitonin, a serum inflammatory marker, in the identification of children with first urinary tract infection (UTI) who might have high-grade (≥3) vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="STUDY DESIGN" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We conducted a meta-analysis of individual data, including all series of children aged 1 month to 4 years with a first UTI, a procalcitonin (PCT) level measurement, cystograms, and an early dimercaptosuccinic acid scan.</fragment>

			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>Of the 152 relevant identified articles, 12 studies representing 526 patients (10% with VUR ≥3) were included. PCT level was associated with VUR ≥3 as a continuous (P = .001), and as a binary variable, with a 0.5 ng/mL preferred threshold (adjusted OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 5.4). The sensitivity of PCT ≥0.5 ng/mL was 83% (95% CI, 71 to 91) with 43% specificity rate (95% CI, 38 to 47). In the subgroup of children with a positive results on dimercaptosuccinic acid scan, PCT ≥0.5 ng/mL was also associated with high-grade VUR (adjusted OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.3 to 17.6).</fragment>

		<title>Dextranomer/hyaluronic acid for pediatric vesicoureteral reflux: systematic review.</title>

		<summary>The overall per-ureter Dx/HA success rate was 77% after 3 months, although success rates varied widely among studies. Increased VUR grade negatively affected success rates, whereas COI, patient age, and injected Dx/HA volume were not significantly associated with treatment outcome after adjustment for VUR grade. There is a significant need for improved reporting of VUR treatments, including comparative studies of Dx/HA and other VUR treatments.</summary>

			<section label="OBJECTIVE" id="OBJECTIVE">
				<fragment>Published success rates of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid (Dx/HA) injection for pediatric vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) vary widely. Our objective of this study was to assess whether underlying patient or study factors could explain the heterogeneity in reported Dx/HA success rates.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="METHODS" id="METHODS">
				<fragment>We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and Medline, Embase, and Scopus databases from 1990 to 2008 for reports in any language, along with a hand search of included study bibliographies. Articles were assessed and data abstracted in duplicate, and differences were resolved by consensus. Conflict of interest (COI) was determined by published disclosure. Meta-regression was performed to adjust for patient as well as study-level factors.</fragment>
			</section>
			<section label="RESULTS" id="RESULTS">
				<fragment>We identified 1157 reports, 89 of which were reviewed in full with 47 included in the pooled analysis. Of 7303 ureters that were injected with Dx/HA, 5633 (77%) were successfully treated according to the authors' definition. Injection success seemed to vary primarily on the basis of the preoperative reflux grade. After adjustment for VUR grade, other factors, such as the presence or absence of COI disclosure, were not significant. Studies were markedly heterogeneous overall.</fragment>
